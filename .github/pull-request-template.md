<!-- General PR guidelines:

New contributors:

If you are new to Git/GitHub and want to make a quick fix to the docs,
open your PR against the release branch where you found the error, such as
"release-0.5".

Regular contributors:

Most PRs should be opened against the master branch.

If the change should also be in the most recent numbered release, add the
corresponding "cherrypick-0.X" label; for example, "cherrypick-0.5", to the
original PR. Best practice is to open a PR for the cherry-pick yourself after
your original PR has been merged into the master branch. Once the cherry-pick PR
has merged, remove the cherry-pick label from the original PR.
