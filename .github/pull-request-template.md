<!-- General PR guidelines:

Most PRs should be opened against the main branch.

If the change should also be in the most recent release, add the
corresponding "cherrypick-0.X" label; for example, "cherrypick-0.12", to the
original PR. Best practice is to open a PR for the cherry-pick yourself after
your original PR has been merged into the main branch. Once the cherry-pick PR
has merged, remove the cherry-pick label from the original PR.
