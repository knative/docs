<!-- General PR guidelines:

Most PRs should be opened against the main branch.

If the change should also be in the most recent release, add the
corresponding "cherrypick-0.X" label; for example, "cherrypick-0.12", to the
original PR. Best practice is to open a PR for the cherry-pick yourself after
your original PR has been merged into the main branch. Once the cherry-pick PR
has merged, remove the cherry-pick label from the original PR.

Use one of the new content templates:
- [Concept](./docs/contributor/templates/template-concept.md) -- Conceptual topics explain how things
work or what things mean. They provide helpful context to readers. They do not include procedures.
- [Procedure](./docs/contributor/templates/template-procedure.md) -- Procedural (how-to) topics
include detailed steps to perform a task as well as some context about the task.
- [Troubleshooting](./docs/contributor/templates/template-troubleshooting.md) -- Troubleshooting 
topics list common errors and solutions.
- [Blog](./docs/contributor/templates/template-blog-entry.md) -- Instructions and a template that you
can use to help you post to the Knative blog.
