Fixes #issue-number

<!-- Most PRs should be opened against the master branch.

If the change should also be in the most recent release, add the
cherrypick-0.X label, for example, cherrypick-0.5. If you can, open a PR for the
cherrypick yourself after your PR has been merged into the master branch. Once
the cherry-pick PR has merged, remove the cherry-pick label. -->
