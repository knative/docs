# Contributing to Knative Documentation

**First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!**

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Knative documentation.
These are just guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to
propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Before you get started

### Code of Conduct

Knative follows the [Knative Code of Conduct](community/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). By
participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable
behavior to knative-code-of-conduct@googlegroups.com.

### Style guide

Knative documentation follows the
[Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style/);
use it as a reference for writing style questions.

## Contributing to Documentation

### Reporting Documentation Issues

Knative uses github issues to track documentation issues and requests. If you
see a documentation issue, submit an issue using the following steps:

1. Check the [Knative docs issues list](https://github.com/knative/docs/issues)
   as you might find out the issue is a duplicate.
2. Use the
   [included template for every new issue](https://github.com/knative/docs/issues/new).
   When you create a bug report, include as many details as possible and include
   suggested fixes to the issue.

Note that code issues should be filed against the individual Knative
repositories, while documentation issues should go in the `docs` repository.

### Put your docs in the right place

Knative uses the [docs repository](https://github.com/knative/docs) for all
general documentation for Knative components. However, formal specifications or
documentation most relevant to contributors of a component should be placed in
the `docs` folder within a given component's repository. An example of this is
the [spec](https://github.com/knative/serving/tree/master/docs/spec) folder
within the Serving component.

Code samples follow a similar strategy, where most code samples should be
located in the `docs` repository. If there are code examples or samples used for
testing that are not expected to be used by non-contributors, those samples can
be put in a `samples` folder within the component repo.

### Submitting Documentation Pull Requests

If you're fixing an issue in the existing documentation, you should submit a PR
against the master branch.
