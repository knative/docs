```diff
- Ideally we set up a query that brings up open PRs associated to the blog 
```

## Submit a Post

Anyone can write a blog post and submit it for review. 
```diff
- We have to decide here if we allow commercial blogposts or not. It would also be useful if we stablish a difference between that and vendor-specific how-to blogs
```

To submit a blog post, follow the steps below.

1. [Sign the CLA](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributor-license-agreements) if you have not yet done so.
1. Have a look at the Markdown format for existing blog posts in the [docs repository](https://github.com/knative/docs/tree/master/blog). Blogposts are categorized in different folders, so you will have to click through to find blog examples.
1. Write out your blog post in a text editor of your choice.
1. On the same link from step 2, click through one of the categories, and click the Create new file button. Paste your content into the editor. Name the file to match the proposed title of the blog post, but don’t put the date in the file name. The blog reviewers will work with you on the final file name and the date the blog will be published.
1. When you save the file, GitHub will walk you through the pull request process.
1. A blog post reviewer will review your submission and work with you on feedback and final details. When the blog post is approved, the blog will be scheduled for publication.

### Blog Guidelines

Requested Content:

```diff
- Ideally, each of these links to a pull request with the specific blog template, see demo for example
```

- Tutorials and demos [start a blog](https://github.com/knative/docs/pull/2511)
- Use cases
- Vendor specific how-to content
- **Original content only**
```diff
- This section needs review 
```

Unsuitable Content:

```diff
- We need to specify what this is
```

## Review Process

Once a blog post is submitted via a PR, it will be routed to the editorial team for review either auto-assigning for a PR.

Each blog post requires a LGTM from one copy editor, technical editor\*, and blog community manager. Once the necessary LGTMs are in place, one of the reviewers will schedule and approve the blog post.

_If a blog post does not contain any technical content (for example, [Knative welcomes new TOC members](https://knative.dev/blog/2020/05/12/knative-welcomes-new-toc-members/)), the technical review can be omitted._

### Embargoed Content

The blog repository on GitHub is public, therefore any content that needs to remain confidential until a certain time (for example: release posts, security vulnerabilities) should be submitted via the form directly. 

```diff
- We need to set up this process
```

### SLA

Blog posts can take up to **2 weeks** to review. 
```diff
- We need to set up an email alias for docs / blog
```
