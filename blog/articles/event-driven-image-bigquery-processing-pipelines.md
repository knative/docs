In this blog post, I will outline two event-driven processing pipelines that I
recently built with Knative Eventing. Along the way, I will explain event sources,
custom events and other components provided by Knative, that greatly simplify the
development of event-driven architectures.

Both of these pipelines are available on GitHub, including source code, configurations, and detailed
instructions, as part of my [Knative Tutorial](https://github.com/meteatamel/knative-tutorial).

## Knative components used

When creating these example pipelines, I relied on a few Knative components that greatly simplified
my development. More specifially:

1. [Event sources](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/sources/) allow you to
   read external events in your cluster. [Knative-GCP
   Sources](https://github.com/google/knative-gcp#knative-gcp-sources) provide a
   number of eventing sources ready to read events from various Google Cloud
   sources.
2. [Broker and triggers](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/broker/) provide
   event delivery without producers or consumers needing to know about how the
   events are routed.
3. **Custom events and event replies**: In Knative, all events are
   [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io/), so it's useful to have a standard format
   for events and various SDKs to read/write them. Knative supports
   custom events and event replies. Any service can receive an event, do some
   processing, create a custom event with new data, and reply back to the broker
   so that other services can read the custom event. This is useful in pipelines,
   where each service does a little bit of work and passes the message forward to the next service.

## Image Processing Pipeline

In this image processing pipeline example, users upload an image to a storage
bucket on Google Cloud, process the image with a number of different Knative
services, and save the processed image to an output bucket.

I defined two requirements for the pipeline:

1. Uploaded images are filtered before they are sent
   through the pipeline. For example, no adult themed or violent images are allowed.
2. The pipeline can contain any number of processing services that can be added or
   removed as needed.

### Architecture

This section explains the architecture of the image processing pipeline. The pipeline is deployed to
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) on Google Cloud.

![Image processing pipeline architecture](https://atamel.dev/img/2020/image-processing-pipeline.png)

1. An image is saved to an input Cloud Storage bucket.
2. A Cloud Storage update event is read into Knative by
   [CloudStorageSource](https://github.com/google/knative-gcp/blob/master/docs/examples/cloudstoragesource/README.md).
3. A filter service receives the Cloud Storage event. It uses the Vision API to
   determine whether the image is safe or should be filtered. If the image is safe, the filter service creates a custom CloudEvent of
   type `dev.knative.samples.fileuploaded` and passes it back to the broker.
4. The resizer service receives the `fileuploaded` event, and then resizes the image using the
   [ImageSharp](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp) library. The service then saves the
   resized image to the output bucket, creates a custom CloudEvent of type
   `dev.knative.samples.fileresized`, and passes the event back to the broker.
5. The watermark service receives the `fileresized` event, adds a watermark to the
   image using the [ImageSharp](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp) library, and
   saves the image to the output bucket.
6. The labeler receives the `fileuploaded` event, extracts labels from the image using the
   Vision API, and saves the labels to the output bucket.

### Test the pipeline

To test the pipeline, I uploaded a picture from my favorite beach,
Ipanema in Rio de Janeiro, to the bucket:

![Beach with sunset](https://atamel.dev/img/2020/beach.jpg)

After a few seconds, I saw 3 files in my output bucket:

```sh
gsutil ls gs://knative-atamel-images-output

gs://knative-atamel-images-output/beach-400x400-watermark.jpeg
gs://knative-atamel-images-output/beach-400x400.png
gs://knative-atamel-images-output/beach-labels.txt
```

We can see the labels `Sky,Body of
water,Sea,Nature,Coast,Water,Sunset,Horizon,Cloud,Shore` in the text file, and
the resized and watermarked image:

## BigQuery Processing Pipeline

This pipeline example is a schedule driven pipeline, which queries
and finds the daily number of COVID-19 cases for the UK and Cyprus. I used a public COVID-19
dataset on BigQuery to get the data, generate charts, and send myself one
email for each country, once a day, containing those charts.

### Architecture

Here's the architecture of the pipeline.

![BigQuery processing pipeline architecture](https://atamel.dev/img/2020/bigquery-processing-pipeline.png)

1. I setup two `CloudSchedulerSources` for two countries (United Kingdom and
   Cyprus) to call the `QueryRunner` service once a day.
2. The QueryRunner service receives the scheduler events for the UK and Cyprus,
   queries COVID-19 cases for each of them using BigQuery's public
   COVID-19 data set, and saves the results in a separate BigQuery table. After this is
   done, the QueryRunner service returns a custom CloudEvent of type
   `dev.knative.samples.querycompleted`.
3. The ChartCreator service receives the `querycompleted`
   CloudEvent, creates a chart from BigQuery data using `Matplotlib`, and saves it to
   a Cloud Storage bucket.
4. The notifier service is another receives the
   `com.google.cloud.storage.object.finalize` CloudEvent from the bucket through a
   CloudStorageSource, and sends an email notification to users using SendGrid.

### Test the pipeline

The CloudSchedulerSource creates CloudScheduler jobs:

```bash
gcloud scheduler jobs list

ID                                                  LOCATION      SCHEDULE (TZ)          TARGET_TYPE  STATE
cre-scheduler-2bcb33d8-3165-4eca-9428-feb99bc320e2  europe-west1  0 16 * * * (UTC)       Pub/Sub      ENABLED
cre-scheduler-714c0b82-c441-42f4-8f99-0e2eac9a5869  europe-west1  0 17 * * * (UTC)       Pub/Sub      ENABLED
```

Trigger the jobs:

```bash
gcloud scheduler jobs run cre-scheduler-2bcb33d8-3165-4eca-9428-feb99bc320e2
```

You should get an email with with a chart similar to this in a few minutes:
