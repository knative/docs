After more than 3 years of active development, with many [commercial adopters](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/main/ADOPTERS.MD), **we are pleased to announce the release of Knative 1.0 on Nov. 2, 2021.** Thanks to the over 600 contributors to Knative for helping us reach this milestone!

During the last several years, Knative has overcome many initial limitations to become the most [widely-installed serverless layer on Kubernetes](https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CNCF_Survey_Report_2020.pdf). There were some challenges in figuring out what the bar for “1.0” was, as many components have been production-ready and battle-tested for quite some time now.

**We believe this milestone brings Knative a big step closer to achieving our mission of simplifying the developer’s experience on Kubernetes and empowering teams to focus on what’s important.**

This is what will happen on Nov. 2, 2021:

* All the repositories covered in ["the release train"](https://github.com/knative/release) will have a 1.0- release.
* The core components (Serving, Eventing) will be [general available (GA)](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/main/mechanics/MATURITY-LEVELS.md#stable); extension components (serving/eventing features, net-* plugins, channel/broker, sources) will either be in Alpha, Beta, or GA state.. Their respective maturity level will be published on their README.md or documentation pages.


**More details will be published on November 2, stay tuned!**

Thank you,
Knative Contributors
