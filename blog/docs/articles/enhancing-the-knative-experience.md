# Enhancing the Knative Experience!

**Author: Prajjwal Yadav, LFX'24 @ Knative**

During the Spring 2024 term, I had the privilege of participating in the LFX Mentorship program, where I researched the contributor experience of Knative under the guidance of mentors [Calum Murray](https://github.com/Cali0707) and [Mariana Mej√≠a](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariana-mejia-design/). The project aimed to identify challenges within the Knative contributor experience and propose actionable recommendations for improvement. 
The participants in this research were the contributors and maintainers of the Knative community. Our goal was to ensure that our recommendations would enhance the overall developer experience for everyone involved with Knative!

## Path to Opportunity

Last year, I began contributing to open source and after making some contributions here and there, I decided to focus on CNCF projects due to their reputation for supportive communities and excellent learning opportunities in cloud-native technologies.

While exploring the [CNCF landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/), I came across the [LFX Mentorship](https://mentorship.lfx.dev/) program. Among the available opportunities, the [Knative: Contributor Journey Research](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/54afaf17-4dc9-4783-9641-a95b5a33af9e) project intrigued me. With some background in full-stack development, community management, and UI/UX, along with the obvious firsthand experience as an 'early-phase' open-source contributor, I felt I had some valuable insights into the common challenges contributors face.

The project required drafting a detailed proposal outlining my implementation plan. I focused on making my proposal as comprehensive as possible ([docs link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10TIymJQ9GpYYRdy3yp9oRMVOSHJ2nkDKqdu_azz8oZg/edit)). With high hopes, I submitted my application, and after the results were announced, I was thrilled to be selected for this exciting opportunity!

## Project Scope

The central focus of my project was to enhance the contributor experience of Knative through user research, with a specific emphasis on retaining contributors more effectively. Given Knative's complexity, onboarding new contributors requires a significant effort from both maintainers and contributors. However, if many contributors leave after only making one or two contributions, the time and effort of the maintainers is wasted. My task was to identify the reasons behind this contributor drop-off and devise strategies to keep contributors engaged for longer periods.

The ultimate deliverable was a report detailing the contributor journey and outlining actionable steps to improve the contributor experience of Knative.

## Mentorship Experience

After receiving the selection email, I had an initial meeting with my mentors to discuss the project's direction. We decided on a weekly mentoring schedule, with occasional analysis sessions as needed. The early weeks were spent planning the research process and defining goals, objectives, key questions, and hypotheses.

To kick off the research phase, I sifted through contributor data spanning from January 1, 2023, to February 29, 2024, to pinpoint potential interview candidates. By the end of the third week, I started outlining some interview and survey questions.
During the next phase, we conducted around twelve interviews with different types of contributors, including new ones, active ones, some who used to contribute but stopped (inactive), and maintainers. It was tough to get interviews with inactive contributors because many weren't using CNCF Slack anymore. However, during the latter half of the project, we did manage to interview three of them, which gave us some really good insights.
Following the interviews and initial analysis, I created a developer survey aimed at understanding the wider community's motivations, engagement, challenges, and potential improvements so that we can prioritize our recommendations based on the responses. Unfortunately, this survey yielded only four responses, making it statistically insignificant.

Upon concluding the interview analysis, I distilled the key findings and preliminary recommendations and presented them to the UX Working Group on May 16, 2024. Subsequently, after receiving feedback during the presentation and on the pull request, I iterated on my findings and recommendations for refinement.

You can find the final report [here](https://github.com/knative/ux/tree/main/user-research/contributor-research).
Any feedback or suggestions on the final report would be greatly appreciated!

## Insights and Future Trajectories

This project and mentorship opportunity taught me a lot about open-source, collaboration, community engagement & dynamics, and importance of prioritizing developer experience. It significantly boosted my confidence and communication skills, as extensive community interaction was a major component.
I am deeply grateful to my mentors for their unwavering support throughout this journey, and I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project.

Moving forward, the next steps involve implementing and evaluating the actionable recommendations. This iterative process will likely involve trial and error to find the most effective solutions.
On a personal note, I am also eager to explore the Knative Eventing project and hopefully contribute to its development.

## Conclusion

Overall, my journey with Knative has been incredibly rewarding and enlightening. I had the opportunity to interact with numerous remarkable individuals from the community, and I am sincerely thankful to all who contributed to this research.
I am excited to witness how these recommendations will be implemented within the Knative community and I firmly believe that by executing these actionable recommendations, we can not only enhance the developer experience for everyone involved in Knative but also strengthen the bonds that unite us as a community!

This experience has definitely deepened my passion for open-source development and community engagement, and I eagerly anticipate continuing my contributions to the Knative ecosystem!
