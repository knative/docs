Knative community is participating in [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (GSOC) program, part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (GSoC for short) is a program that brings more contributors into open
source software development. Contributors work on a 1.5 or 3-month programming project with an open source
organization in the summer.

Knative has been accepted as an [incubating CNCF project](https://knative.dev/blog/steering/cncf/) and we are happy to see Google's announcement of accepting the CNCF as a mentoring organization for GSoC.


You may find the Knative project ideas under the CNCF project ideas page at [CNCF/mentoring](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/blob/main/summerofcode/2022.md#knative). You can also participate in the discussions at the [Github discussions](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/discussions).

Specifically, Knative community has 2 ideas that are both interesting and welcoming.

The [first idea](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/blob/main/summerofcode/2022.md#improve-knative-eventing-end-to-end-observability-by-addressing-top-issues-identified-by-community) is a research project that would help Knative community to improve the observability within the Knative components. The project consists on addressing community-identified issues and also doing further research.

The [second idea](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/blob/main/summerofcode/2022.md#make-knative-running-on-edge) is also a research project. Contributors are going to be mentored to experiment with Knative components on various edge computing scenarios.

You can join the discussions in these ideas in the Github discussions at the CNCF/mentoring ([idea #1](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/discussions/618), [idea #2](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/discussions/619)).

GSoC contributor applications [start](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) on April 4th and last for 2 weeks! So, it is a good time to start interacting with the mentors and the community!
