Knative community is participating in [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (GSOC) program, part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (GSoC for short) is a program that brings more contributors into open
source software development. Contributors work on a 1.5 or 3-month programming project with an open source organization in the summer.

Although Google will announce accepted organizations in March, we are already working on the ideas list for the program to give any potential contributors a head start.

You may find the Knative project ideas under the CNCF project ideas page at [CNCF/mentoring](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/blob/main/summerofcode/2023.md#knative). You can also participate in the discussions at the [Github discussions](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/discussions).

Knative community's [GSoC document](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/main/google-summer-of-code/gsoc-2023.md) gives you some tips and pointers on how to get started.

GSoC contributor applications [start](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) on March 20th! So, it is a good time to start interacting with the mentors and the community!

For more information about the GSoC at the CNCF, please see the [CNCF+GSoC document](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/tree/main/summerofcode) and the [Knative+GSoC document](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/main/google-summer-of-code/gsoc-2023.md).
