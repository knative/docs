# Knative at KubeCon â€™22 North America

**Date: 2022-10-20**

There's less than a week until
[KubeCon + KnativeCon North America 2022](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/)
kicks off in Detroit, MI.
We are excited that the Knative community will be well represented at both events,
and that once again we are hosting a full day of Knative content at the
[KnativeCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/knativecon-north-america/) co-located event.

We wanted to share with you a few of the Knative
talks you can attend at the conferences to learn more about the Knative project and
its progress in the past year.

## Monday, October 24 KnativeCon

Join us for a full day of Knative content at KnativeCon. This year we have a
variety of talks covering Knative's core components, use cases, and the future of
the project. Check out the full schedule on [Sched](https://knativeconna22.sched.com/).

## Tuesday, October 25 KubeCon

On Tuesday, October 25, we have a 4-hour open
[Knative project meeting](https://sched.co/1BaTW) for maintainers
and others who are contributing to the project. The meeting will last from 1 to 5pm
and will be a great opportunity for Knative contributors to meet and discuss the
the status and future of the project.

Afterwards, Lance Ball will be giving a
[5 minute lighting talk](https://sched.co/184sX) on building a Twitter
bot with Knative Functions. The talk will be at 5:45pm and should be a lot of fun!

## Wednesday, October 26 KubeCon

On Wednesday, from 11am to 12:30pm, Evan Andersen and Paul Schweigert will be hosting a
[Knative ContribFest](https://sched.co/182Pu) where you can get involved in the project
by learning the tools and processes for contributing to Knative. Join them to develop the skills and knowledge to be a part of the exciting the Knative project.

Later that afternoon, Evan will again be on the stage, this time with Naina Singh,
Lance Ball, and Mauricio Salatino, to talk about Knative Functions, a new addition
to the project this year. This [panel talk](https://sched.co/182N0) starts at 3:25pm
with a brief demo of the Functions project, a discussion of the project's goals and
then a Q&A session. This is a great opportunity to learn more about Knative Functions.

## See you soon!

We are looking forward to seeing you in Detroit next week, and hope you enjoy
