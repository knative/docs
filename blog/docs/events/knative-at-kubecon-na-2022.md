# Knative at KubeCon â€™22 North America

**Date: 2022-10-20**

There's less than a week until
[KubeCon + KnativeCon North America 2022](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/)
kicks off in Detroit, MI.
We are excited that the Knative community will be well represented at both events,
and that once again we are hosting a full day of Knative content at the
[KnativeCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/knativecon-north-america/) co-located event.

We wanted to share with you a few of the Knative
talks you can attend at the conferences to learn more about the Knative project and
its progress in the past year.
