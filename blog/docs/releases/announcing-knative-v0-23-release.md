### Serving v0.23

<!-- Original notes are here: https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/tag/v0.23.0 -->

#### üö® Breaking or Notable Changes

- Change the default post-install job to use sslip.io rather than xip.io. [#11298](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11298)

#### üí´ New Features & Changes

- The stats scraping in the autoscaler is now sensitive to the `EnableMeshPodAddressability` setting. A restart of the autoscaler is required for the setting to take effect if changed. [#11161](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11161)
- The state keeping in the activator is now sensitive to the `EnableMeshPodAddressability` setting. A restart of the activator is required for the setting to take effect if changed. [#11172](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11172)
- Tightens the heuristic for mesh being enabled in the service scraper. We now expect all errors to be related to mesh (i.e. 503 status code). This prevents accidentally falling in to service scrape mode when errors are encountered for other reasons. [#11174](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11174)

#### üêû Bug Fixes

- Added schemas to all CRDs. [#11244](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11244)
- Changed the rollout behavior of application deployment changes (due to Knative upgrade for example) to never have less ready posd than required. [#11140](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11140)
- Rate limits digest resolution (10 QPS, retry back-off 1s to 1000s) to prevent exceeding quota at remote registries [#11279](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11279)
- Revision replicas now shut down 15 seconds faster. [#11249](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11249)
- The activator proxy now recognizes the `EnableMeshPodAddressability` setting. [#11162](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11162)
- Update the User-Agent used during tag resolution [#10590](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/10590)

#### üßπ Clean up

#### üí´ New Features & Changes

#### RabbitMQ Eventing v0.23

<!-- Original notes are here: https://github.com/knative-sandbox/eventing-rabbitmq/releases/tag/v0.23.0 -->

#### üö® Breaking or Notable Changes

- requires [messaging-topology-operator](https://github.com/rabbitmq/messaging-topology-operator) version `v0.8.0` to be installed as well as [cluster-operator](https://github.com/rabbitmq/cluster-operator) version `v1.6.0`

#### üêû Bug Fixes

- Conformance tests for Broker now work
- If a Broker / Trigger is deleted but there's no secret to talk to the rabbit cluster, we now remove the resources and log that rabbitmq resources might have been leaked. This happens only when not using the Rabbit Cluster Operator. This left undeletable resources, so this change seems more user friendly.
