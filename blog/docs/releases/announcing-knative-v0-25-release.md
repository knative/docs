### Serving v0.25

<!-- Original notes are here: https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/tag/v0.25.0 -->

#### üö® Breaking or Notable Changes

- **Renaming of some `net-kourier` component**

    Related issue: [knative/networking#448](https://github.com/knative/networking/issues/448)

    As part of our efforts to GA/1.0 we've standardized on the naming of our networking plugins that
    are installed alongside Serving. If you're managing your Knative deployment manually with
    `kubectl` **this will require a two-phase upgrade process**. In order to upgrade [net-kourier to v0.25.0](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-kourier/releases/tag/v0.25.0) using `kubectl` please follow the steps:

        ```bash
        # Apply the new release
        $ kubectl apply -f net-kourier.yaml

        # Once the deployment is ready apply the same file but
        # prune the old resources
        $ kubectl apply -f net-kourier.yaml \
        --prune -l networking.knative.dev/ingress-provider=kourier
        ```
- **Disabling namespace certificate provisioning legacy label**

    The namespace label `networking.internal.knative.dev/disableWildcardCert` has been deprecated since `v0.15.0` release in favour of `networking.knative.dev/disableWildcardCert`. We have dropped support for this legacy label ([#11626](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11626))

#### üí´ New Features & Changes

- A feature flag is available to enable priorityClassName for Knative Services. See config-features for details. ([#11746](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11746))
- Add memory metrics for HPA: `hpa.autoscaling.knative.dev` ([#11668](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11668))
- Added `app.kubernetes.io/name` labels to resources. It will be replacing app labels in the future. ([#11655](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11655))
- Users can set in the field `spec.template.spec.containers[*].securityContext.runAsNonRoot` to true in a PodSpec without a feature flag ([#11606](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11606))
- Users can set in the field `spec.template.spec.automountServiceAccountToken` to false in a PodSpec in order to opt-out of Kubenetes' default behaviour of mounting a ServiceAccount token in that Pod's containers. ([#11723](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11723))
- Add `v1beta1` version of DomainMapping CRD ([#11682](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11682))

#### üêû Bug Fixes

- Set `ENABLE_HTTP2_AUTO_DETECTION` to false by default if the feature is not enabled. ([#11760](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11760))
