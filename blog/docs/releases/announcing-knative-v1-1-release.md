### Serving v1.1

<!-- Original notes are here: https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/tag/knative-v1.1.0 -->

#### üí´ New Features & Changes

- Add cluster wide default min-scale ([#12290](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/12290))
- HPA autoscaler stabilization window can be set from autoscaling window annotation ([#12286](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/12286))
- Metrics with names other than "cpu" or "memory" are allowed as pod custom metrics ([#12277](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/12277))

#### üêû Bug Fixes

- Allow setting TCP and HTTP port to be equal to containerPort on readiness and liveness probes ([#12225](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/12225))
- Drops the unix socket listener from Queue Proxy, since it is no longer used ([#12298](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/12298))
- Generated HPAs are now v2beta2. Window annotation will be set to HPA stabilization window ([#12278](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/12278))
- Remove performance tests using Mako ([#12266](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/12266))
- The activator optimization which directly probes the queue proxy for readiness rather than waiting for Kubernetes to report readiness is now disabled when exec probes are used (since queue proxy cannot execute these probes on the user container's behalf) ([#12250](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/12250))
- Use pkg/drain in queue proxy ([#12033](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/12033))

#### üí´ New Features & Changes

- The kafka-controller deployment emits probe requests against the data plane (kafka-sink-receiver and kafka-broker-receiver) to determine Kafka Broker and KafkaSink readiness ([#1495](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/eventing-kafka-broker/pull/1495))
- You can now configure which header format (b3 multi header, b3 single header, and w3c trace-context) to be used while using Zipkin backend ([#1546](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/eventing-kafka-broker/pull/1546))

#### RabbitMQ Broker and Source v1.1

<!-- Original notes are here: https://github.com/knative-sandbox/eventing-rabbitmq/releases/tag/knative-v1.1.0 -->

- RabbitMQ source now can use predefined queues instead of creating new ones ([#493](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/eventing-rabbitmq/pull/493))

- Do not expose the broker class that the controller operates on as an environment variable ([#512](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/eventing-rabbitmq/pull/512))

    - Avoids re-wrapping RabbitMQ messages that are already in the CloudEvent format

#### üêû Bug Fixes

- The trigger dispatcher will now only retry deliveries when response status codes status are 5XX, 404, 409, 429, or -1 ([#486](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/eventing-rabbitmq/pull/486))
