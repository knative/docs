### Serving
**Release Notes:** [Knative Serving 1.17](https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/tag/knative-v1.17.0)

#### üí´ New Features & Changes
- Adding support for the "hostPath" volume type. This feature is behind the flag `kubernetes.podspec-volumes-hostpath`. ([#15648](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/15648), @amarflybot)
- Add default container annotation to Pods created by the reconciler ([#15694](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/15694), @konstfish)
- Allow explicitly setting `containers.securityContext.privileged` to `false` ([#15643](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/15643), @KapilSareen)
- Kubernetes Deployments created for a Knative Revision are not configured with revisionHistoryLimit=0 to save storage space. ([#15698](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/15698), @SaschaSchwarze0)

#### üêû Bug Fixes
- A revision is now set to ContainerHealthy=True when it has ready replicas ([#15503](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/15503), @SaschaSchwarze0)
- Fixes previously supported probe syntax without a leading slash. ([#15681](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/15681), @skonto)
- Fixes revision timeout defaulting when identical values are present in timeout settings. ([#15617](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/15617), @skonto)
- Fixes a problem in configuration reconciliation where labeler creates a different order of the route names listed via the annotation `serving.knative.dev/routes` compared to the configuration reconciler. ([#15601](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/15601), @skonto)


### Eventing
**Release Notes:** [Knative Eventing 1.17](https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases/tag/knative-v1.17.0)

### üö® Breaking or Notable Changes
- [Action required] for the callers of the `knative.dev/eventing/pkg/graph` package. The constructor that has previously accepted a `rest.RestConfig` is now accepting clients (Kubernetes clients) directly instead of creating them in the package. ([#8399](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/8399), @aliok)
- The event lineage package does not swallow the 400 and 401 errors anymore. Callers should handle those errors themselves. ([#8401](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/8401), @aliok)

#### üí´ New Features & Changes
- Add IntegrationSink for supporting generic event sinks based on Apache Camel Kamelets. ([#8304](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/8304), @matzew)
- Add IntegrationSource for supporting generic event sources based on Apache Camel Kamelets. ([#8304](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/8304), @matzew)
- Added the RequestReply CRD and types (no controller/data plane implementation yet) ([#8337](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/8337), @Cali0707)
- Allow configuring (opt-in) IMC async handler ([#8311](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/8311), @pierDipi)
- EventType autocreate now creates v1beta3 EventTypes ([#8276](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/8276), @Cali0707)
- JobSink: Inject a `K_EXECUTION_MODE` environment variable with value `batch` ([#8346](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/8346), @pierDipi)
- JobSink: bind secrets lifecycle to associated jobs lifecycle. Using OwnerReference and k8s garbage collection, now a secret created for a given event is bound to a given Job lifecycle, so that when a job is deleted, the associated secret will be deleted. ([#8331](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/8331), @pierDipi)
- MT-Broker: return retriable status code based on the state to leverage retries ([#8366](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/8366), @pierDipi)
- Made request reply timeout configurable through config-features ([#8361](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/8361), @AlexMamoukarys)
- The minimum Kubernetes version is now 1.30.x ([#8411](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/8411), @pierDipi)
