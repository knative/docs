### Serving v1.2

<!-- Original notes are here: https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/tag/knative-v1.2.0 -->

#### 🚨 Breaking or Notable Changes

- Our minimum Kubernetes version is now v1.21. ([#12509](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/12509))
- PodDisruptionBudget updated to v1 API. ([#12548](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/12548))

#### 💫 New Features & Changes

- Changes liveness probes to directly probe the user container rather than queue proxy. ([#12479](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/12479))
- Improves the error message when a DomainMapping cannot be reconciled because `autocreate-cluster-domain-claims` is false and the CDC does not exist. ([#12439](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/12439))
- Utilizes Kubernetes's immediate trigger of readiness probes after startup. Restores default `periodSeconds` for readiness probe to Kubernetes default (10s). ([#12550](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/12550))

#### 🐞 Bug Fixes

- TODO: Add bugs here

### Eventing v1.2

<!-- Original notes are here: https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases/tag/knative-v1.2.0 -->

#### 🚨 Breaking or Notable Changes

- Change default Broker delivery spec. ([#6011](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/6011))
- Unify inconsistent ConfigMaps ([#5875](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/5875)):
    - The Channel template in the ConfigMap that Brokers use to declare the underlying channel must be located under the `channel-template-spec` element. The previous `channelTemplateSpec` element has been deprecated.
    - PingSource's ConfigMap element for maximum size has been redefined as `data-max-size`.
    The previous `dataMaxSize` element has been deprecated.

#### 💫 New Features & Changes

- Traces generated by PingSource includes some Kubernetes attributes: `k8s.namespace`, `k8s.name`, `k8s.resource`. ([#5928](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/5928))
- Add new `new-trigger-filters` experimental feature. When enabled, Triggers support a new `filters` field that conforms to the filters API field defined in the [CloudEvents Subscriptions API](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/subscriptions/spec.md#324-filters). It allows you to specify a set of powerful filter expressions, where each expression evaluates to either true or false for each event. ([#5995](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/5995))


#### 🐞 Bug Fixes

- Fixes the following vulnerabilities ([#6057](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/6057)):
    - `github.com/knative/pkg` contains a dependency that is subject to DoS attack.
    - `github.com/kubernetes/utils` contains a security issue that was discovered where a user might be able to create a container with subpath volume mounts to access files and directories outside of the volume, including on the host filesystem.


### Eventing Extensions

#### Apache Kafka Broker v1.2

<!-- Original notes are here: https://github.com/knative-sandbox/eventing-kafka-broker/releases/tag/knative-v1.2.0 -->

#### 💫 New Features & Changes

- An HTTP header will be supplied to your event consumers when the Broker it is communicating with supports reply events.
This will always be sent while using this Kafka Broker since it supports handling reply events. ([#1771](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/eventing-kafka-broker/pull/1771))

- Apply back-pressure by limiting the number of in-flight dispatch requests in the unordered event consumption. ([#1750](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/eventing-kafka-broker/pull/1750))

- Support TLS for the metrics server. Now, the receiver and the dispatcher accept the following environment variables ([#1707](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/eventing-kafka-broker/pull/1707)):
    - `METRICS_PEM_CERT_PATH`: TLS cert path
    - `METRICS_PEM_KEY_PATH`: TLS key path
    - `METRICS_HOST`: metrics server host
