- Dropped the alpha field `RevisionSpec.MaxDurationSeconds` in favour of fixing the behavior of the existing `Timeout` field. ([#12635](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/12635))


### üí´ New Features & Changes

- Allows the readiness probe port to be different than the user container port. ([#12606](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/12606))
- `net-certmanager` starts testing cert-manager v1.7.1. ([#12605](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/12605))

### üêû Bug Fixes

- Bumped prometheus/client_golang to v1.11.1 in order to address [CVE-2022-21698](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cg3q-j54f-5p7p). ([#12653](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/12653))
- Ensure the activator drains properly and the autoscaler rolls out conservatively.
This helps to avoid hitting 503 errors during upgrade. ([#12617](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/12617))
- Fixed an activator crash that could disrupt traffic (503). ([#12679](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/12679))
- Fixed the tag to digest resolution when the registry credential is in a Kubernetes secret. ([#12655](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/12655))
- Provides more detailed error messages for invalid values of `autoscaling.knative.dev/initial-scale`. ([#12704](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/12704))
- Removed an unnecessary start delay when resolving a tag to digest. ([#12668](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/12668))
- Switches selectors for Knative resources to use the recommended `app.kubernetes.io` labels. ([#12587](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/12587))
- The validating webhook returns a more accurate error for invalid `autoscaling.knative.dev/target` values. ([#12698](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/12698))
- Updates serving configmap validating webhook to use an objectSelector to reduce unnecessary webhook invocations. ([#12612](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/12612))


## Eventing v1.3

<!-- Original notes are here: https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases/tag/knative-v1.3.1 -->

### üö® Breaking or Notable Changes

- The sql field of the [new trigger filters](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/experimental-features/new-trigger-filters/) experimental feature is now called cesql. ([#6148](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/6148))

### üí´ New Features & Changes

- Added missing Kubernetes labels to post install manifests. ([#6184](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/6184))

### üêû Bug Fixes

- When the new-trigger-filters experimental feature is enabled, a bug was fixed where some invalid CE SQL expressions caused the Eventing webhook to crash. Now, those expressions will be considered invalid and the webhook will continue functioning normally. ([#6140](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/6140))
