## Serving

[Release Notes](https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/tag/knative-v1.7.1)

### üí´ New Features & Changes

- Adds a `autoscaling.knative.dev/activation-scale` annotation that allows the user to set a minimum number of replicas when not scaled to zero. Note that the initial target scale for a revision is still handled by `initial-scale`; `activation-scale` will only apply on subsequent scales from zero. [#13161](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/13161)

### üêûBug Fixes

- Readiness probes no longer fail if the user container is restarted (due to a liveness probe failure). [#13229](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/13229)

## Eventing

[Release Notes](https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases/tag/knative-v1.7.1)

- The delivery timeout feature is now beta and enabled by default. [#6472](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/6472)
- The strict subscriber feature for Subscription API is now beta and enabled by default.
