## General

### üö® Breaking or Notable

* Our macOS binaries have been notarized so you should be able to run them right away when downloading them from GitHub without having to change Gatekeeper settings.

### üí´ New Release

* [Security-Guard Alpha](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/security-guard/releases/tag/v0.2.0) is now released to allow cyber monitoring and control of knative services.

## Serving

[Release Notes](https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/tag/knative-v1.8.0)

### üö® Breaking or Notable

- Uses the cluster domain suffix `svc.cluster.local` as the default domain. As routes using the cluster domain suffix are not exposed through Ingress, users will need to [configure DNS](https://knative.dev/docs/install/yaml-install/serving/install-serving-with-yaml/#configure-dns) in order to expose their services (most users probably already are). ((#13259, @psschwei)
- Upgrade HorizontalPodAutoscaler to autoscaling/v2 API version (#13337, @nader-ziada)
- Services may now set `seccompProfile` in SecurityContext to allow users to comply with the `restricted` Pod Security Standards best-practice (#13401, @evankanderson)
- Bump min-version to k8s 1.23, so removing kind 1.22 testing (#13357, @nader-ziada)
- Increase the outbound context deadline in reconcilers to 30s (from 10s) to match the maximum K8s webhook timeout. (#13323, @mattmoor)

### üí´ New Features & Changes

- Add timeout handling in Activator  when processing a request for a revision (#13261, @nader-ziada)
- EmptyDir volumes feature flag is now enabled by default (#13405, @dprotaso)
- Queue proxy explicit set `SeccompProfile` to `RunTimeDefault` to be able to run under restricted PSP policy by default. (#13376, @skonto)
- Save data from perf tests to create a dashboard. (#13192, @nader-ziada)

### üêûBug Fixes

- Knative services can now specify securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation (#13395, @mattmoor)
- ConfigMap config-defaults property `revision-response-start-timeout-seconds` now defaults to `revision-timeout-seconds`. This should unblock upgrades who set `revision-timeout-seconds` lower than the default value of 300 (#13255, @dprotaso)
- Fix LatestReadyRevision semantics so it only advances forward. When a Revision fails the Configuration & Route will no longer fall back to older revision. The exception is when you rollback to a Revision that is explicitly named. (#13239, @dprotaso)

## Eventing

[Release Notes](https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases/tag/knative-v1.8.0)

### üö® Breaking or Notable

* The HorizontalPodAutoscaler manifests have been updated to v2, which is available with k8s 1.23+ (#6549, @matzew)
* Add readiness and liveness probes in Knative Eventing controller (#6566, @lionelvillard)
* Update k8s library to 1.25.2 (#6561, @lionelvillard)
* Update pelletier/go-toml/v2 to v2.0.5 (#6574, @dsimansk)

### üí´ New Features & Changes

* InMemoryChannel receiver validates received events (#6511, @pierDipi)

### üêûBug Fixes

* Fixing PodSecurity Policy warnings for restricted environments (#6533, @matzew)
* Remove check for v1 API of ConfigMap as there is only v1 CMs (#6502, @matzew)
* Fixes issue with sugar controller always setting the broker class to MTChannelBasedBroker instead of using the defaults ConfigMap (#6500, @gab-satchi)
* Port old e2e containersource test to reconciler test (#6507, @liuchangyan)
* Remove strict check in scorer plugins and respect max skew parameter. Requeue request when no pods available rather than fail scheduler. (#6524, @aavarghese)

## Client

[Release Notes](https://github.com/knative/client/releases/tag/knative-v1.8.0)

#### üí´ New Features & Changes

* Add `--scale-activation` flag to `service create` command options (#1729, @vyasgun)
* Provide cli options to enable Kubernetes user, uid, and group impersonation via `--as`, `--as-group` and `--as-uid` flags (#1745, @a7i)

### Bug or Regression

* Fix release script version calculation (#1737, @dsimansk)
