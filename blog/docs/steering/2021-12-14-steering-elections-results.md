Hello Knative community,

We are happy to announce that [Carlos Santana](https://twitter.com/csantanapr) and [Lance Ball](https://github.com/lance) are our newly elected [Steering Committee](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/main/STEERING-COMMITTEE.md) members with both serving a 2-year term. Please take a moment to congratulate them!

The competition was fierce with 6 very strong candidates to choose from, so thank you to everyone who ran in this election and everyone who took the time to cast your ballot!

As announced recently in [Knativeâ€™s application](https://knative.dev/blog/steering/knative-cncf-donation/) to become a CNCF incubating project, [April Nassi](https://twitter.com/thisisnotapril) will remain on the Steering Committee for one more year to help coordinate the transition of infrastructure and ensure a smooth process to bring Knative into the CNCF.

Lance and Carlos will serve together with continuing Steering Committee members [Paul Morie](https://twitter.com/cheddarmint), [Ville Aikas](https://twitter.com/AikasVille), and April Nassi. We would also like to thank our outgoing member [Michael Behrendt](https://twitter.com/michael_beh) for his service as one of the original Steering Committee members serving over the past several years.

We want to thank our Steering Election Officers Dawn Foster and Josh Berkus for their help on running this election.

The Knative Steering Committee (KSC) is
[responsible for the general health of the Knative community](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md).

We hope you all have a restful remainder of 2021. Happy holidays!

Knative Steering Committee
