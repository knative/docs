title: 2021 Steering Committee End User Seat Election
date: 2021-12-17
---

Hello, Knative community,

We want to kick off the Knative Steering Committee End User election, and we are ready to accept nominations from End Users!

This will be the first time an End User is elected to become a member of the Knative Steering Committee (SC).

The Knative Steering Committee is responsible for the general health of the Knative community. The End User seat will bring more diversity into the Steering Committee representation, which the Steering Committee will elect.

If you want to stand for election, we have detailed instructions in the [Steering Committee End User guide](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/main/elections/2021-SC-EU/enduser.md)


Here are a few important deadlines to keep in mind:

- January 26: All candidate nominations due by 0000 UTC
- January 31: Announcement of selection


Cheers,
Knative Steering Committee (SC)
