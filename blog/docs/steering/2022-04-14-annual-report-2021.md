Hello Knative community,

We have created a 2021 Knative annual report for the community and we are thrilled to share it. The report can be viewed [here](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/main/annual_reports/Knative%202021%20Annual%20Report.pdf).

Some of the significant highlights

* Knative 1.0.
* Knative applied for incubation to CNCF.
* 563k+ downloads from Github.
* 247 releases across 25 repos.

We just want to say *thank you* to all our community members for contributing and
helping us grow our community. We definitely could not have done it without you!

Cheers,

Knative Steering Committee (SC)
