**_Author: [Ali Ok](https://github.com/aliok), on behalf of the [Knative Steering Committee](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/main/STEERING-COMMITTEE.md)_**

Knative [joined CNCF](https://knative.dev/blog/steering/cncf/) in 2022, and the
ownership of the branding and trademark has been transferred to the CNCF.
As a result, the committee that was responsible for these matters, the Knative 
Trademark Committee, was not really needed anymore. The Knative Trademark 
Committee has decided to dissolve itself, and the Steering Committee 
will handle any trademark matters.

You may find the recording of the last meeting of the Knative Trademark Committee
and the dissolution decision [here](https://github.com/knative/community/issues/1399).

Branding, trademark usage, conformance and scope matters that were previously 
handled by the Knative Trademark Committee will now be handled by the 
Steering Committee. Knative Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) 
will advise the Steering Committee on conformance and scope matters. 

The Steering Committee will coordinate with the CNCF to ensure that the project's 
trademarks are protected and used in a way that is consistent with the project's goals.

You may find the record of the dissolved Knative Trademark Committee charter document  
[here](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/fa4340e96c0eeb69151be0f512a8970083d99a05/TRADEMARK-COMMITTEE.md).

We would like to thank the emeritus members of the Knative Trademark Committee for their
service and dedication to the project.
