## Announcing Knative v0.17 Release

A new version of Knative is now available across multiple components.
Follow the instructions in the documentation [Installing Knative](https://knative.dev/docs/install/) for the respective component.
- Serving continues their journey with test and benchmark optimizations on the already v1 API version.
- Eventing now provides ContainerSource and PingSource as v1beta1.
- `kn` CLI continues the journey to full Eventing support adding Channel resources.
- Operator adds support of customized manifests for Knative installation.

Remember to check the [upgrade docs](https://knative.dev/docs/install/upgrade-installation/) for any concerns applicable to your current version before you upgrade to the latest version.


### Serving v0.17

**InitialScale annotation to control the initial deployment size**

There is a new annotation that can be used to control the number of pods that are initially deployed when new Revisions are rolled out.

**net-contour and net-kourier have moved to Beta**

In addition to net-istio, Knative now supports three other networking layers that are in Beta status.

**Kubernetes minimum version has NOT changed**

Kubernetes **1.16** remains as the minimum version.
