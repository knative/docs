## Announcing Knative v0.18 Release

A new version of Knative is now available across multiple components.
Follow the instructions in the documentation [Installing Knative](https://knative.dev/docs/install/) for the respective component.

- Kubernetes minimum version has changed to v1.17
  - See our [K8s minimum version principle](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/master/mechanics/RELEASE-VERSIONING-PRINCIPLES.md#k8s-minimum-version-principle)
- Eventing APIs gradauted from v1beta1 to v1
- Eventing Contribution sources are moved to a new github organization [knative-sandbox](https://github.com/knative-sandbox)
- The `kn` CLI now has alias for commands and other new features.

Remember to check the [upgrade docs](https://knative.dev/docs/install/upgrade-installation/) for any concerns applicable to your current version before you upgrade to the latest version.


### Serving v0.18

**Serving v1alpha1 & v1beta1 will EOL in our next release (v0.19)**
- This applies to the resources: Service, Route, Revision, Configuration
- You will want to migrate your storage version for these resources to v1 using our [post-install job](https://github.com/knative/serving/blob/master/config/post-install/storage-version-migration.yaml)

**Breaking EnableVarLogCollection behaviour**
- We always mount a emptyDir volume at /var/log in our user-containers. This impacts some popular containers images (ie. nginx) preventing them from starting.
- In the next release (v0.19) we plan on changing this default behaviour and only mount a volume when EnableVarLogCollection is set to true.
- Please reach out in [#7881](https://github.com/knative/serving/issues/7881) if you have issues/comments about the approach & timeline.

**net-contour has moved to stable status**

**Kubernetes minimum version changed to 1.17**

### Client v0.18

Release 0.18.0 of the Knative client `kn` comes with some bug fixes plus some additional support for Knative eventing features

<details><summary>Eventing Support</summary>

The `kn channel` support has been extended by a `kn channel list-types` which shows you all the channel types that are available in the cluster.
This information can be used to select the type when creating a channel with `kn channel create`.

Subscriptions which connect a sink with a channel can now be fully managed with `kn subscription` commands.

</details>

<details><summary>Aliases</summary>

For a better user experience we added some aliases for commonly used commands:

| Command | ALias |
| --- | --- |
| service | ksvc, services |
| revision | revisions |
| route | routes |
| source | sources |
| broker | brokers |
| trigger | triggers |
| channel | channels |
| subscription | subscriptions, sub |
| plugin | plugins |
| list | ls |

</details>

<details><summary>Other Changes</summary>

- You can use now `--annotation-service` and `--annotation-revision` to select the part of Knative service where you want to put an annotation on. With `--annotation` you add an annotation to both parts, the Knative service's annotation and to the annotation of the Pod template used to create revisions.
- A new option `--scale-init` allows to specify the initial number of pods that should be created when a Knative service is created. By default this number is one, but you can set it to 0 if you don't want to create a pod during service creation.

</details>
