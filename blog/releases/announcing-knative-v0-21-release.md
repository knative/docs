### Serving v0.21

#### üö® Breaking or Notable

- Kubernetes minimum version has changed to v1.18
    - See our [K8s minimum version principle](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/master/mechanics/RELEASE-VERSIONING-PRINCIPLES.md#k8s-minimum-version-principle)
- GC v1 and Labeler v1 deprecated and removed from the code base
- Webhooks certificates now use Ed25519 instead of RSA/2048 and have an expiry of one week ([knative/pkg#1998](https://github.com/knative/pkg/pull/1998))

#### üí´ New Features & Changes

- Introduces autocreateClusterDomainClaim in config-network config map. This allows DomainMappings to be safely used in shared clusters by disabling automatic ClusterDomainClaim creation. With this option set to "false", cluster administrators must explicitly delegate domain names to namespaces by creating a ClusterDomainClaim with an appropriate spec.Namespace set. ([#10537](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/10537))
- Domain mappings disallow mapping from cluster local domain names (generally domains under "cluster.local") ([#10798]())
- Allow setting ReadOnlyRootFilesystem on the container's SecurityContext ([#10560](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/10560))
- A container's readiness probe FailureThreshold & TimeoutSeconds are now defaulted to 3 and 1 respectively when a user opts into non-aggressive probing (ie. PeriodTimeout > 1) ([#10700](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/10700))
- Avoids implicitly adding an "Accept-Encoding: gzip" header to proxied requests if one was not already present. ([#10691](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/10691))
- Gradual Rollout is possible to set on individual Revisions usingserving.knative.dev/rolloutDuration annotation, ([#10561](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/10561))
- Support Istio 1.9 (knative-sandbox/net-istio#515](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-istio/pull/515))
- Support Contour 1.12 (knative-sandbox/net-contour#414](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-contour/pull/414))

#### üêû Bug Fixes

- Fixes problem with domainmapping when working with auto-tls and kourier challenge ([#10811](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/10811)
- Fixed a bug where the activator's metrics could get stuck and thus scale to and from zero didn't work as expected. ([#10729](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/10729))
- Fixes a race in Queue Proxy drain logic that could, in a very unlikely edge case, lead to the pre-stop hook not exiting even though draining has finished ([#10781](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/10781))
- Avoid slow out-of-memory issue related to metrics ([knative/pkg#2005](https://github.com/knative/pkg/pull/2020))
- Stop reporting reflector metrics since they were removed upstream ([knative/pkg#2020](https://github.com/knative/pkg/pull/2020))

### Eventing v0.21

#### üö® Breaking or Notable

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: PingSource binary mode now sends the actual binary data in event body instead of base64-encoded form. (#4851](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4851), @eclipselu)
- You need to run the storage migration tool after the upgrade to migrate from `v1beta1` to `v1beta2` `pingsources.sources.knative.dev` resources. (#4750](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4750), @eclipselu)


#### üí´ New Features & Changes

- Adding HorizontalPodAutoscaler and PodDisruptionBudget for the eventing webhook ([#4792](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4792))
- Add [event reply header contract](https://github.com/knative/eventing/blob/release-0.21/docs/spec/data-plane.md#event-reply-contract) to the spec ([#4560](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4560))
- Cloudevent traces available for PingSource ([#4877](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4877))
- CloudEvents send to dead-letter endpoints include extension attribute called ce-knativedispatcherr which contains encoded HTTP Response error information from final dispatch attempt. ([#4760](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4760), @travis-minke-sap)
- Message receiver supports customized liveness and readiness check ([#4730](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4730))

The new attributes are messaging.destination, messaging.message_id, messaging.protocol and messaging.system ([#4659](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4659))
- Add Trigger.Delivery field which allows configuration of Delivery per Trigger. ([#4654](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4654))

#### üêû Bug Fixes

- Fix availability of zipkin traces for APIServerSource ([#4842](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4842))

- Fix bug where v1beta1 would allow mutations to immutable fields. v1beta1 trigger.spec.broker is immutable. ([#4843](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4843))

#### üßπ Clean up

- Now the config-imc-event-dispatcher values are not configurable on-fly anymore, that is, if you need to configure such values, you need to redeploy the dispatcher deployment ([#4543](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4543))
- PingSource: remove special handling of JSON data since events are always sent in binary mode. ([#4858](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/4858))

### Client v0.21

#### üö® Breaking or Notable

**Revision naming**

In this version, kn changes the default of how revisions are named. Up to now, the name was selected by the client itself, leveraging the "bring-your-own" (BYO) revision name support of Knative serving.

However, it turned out that this mode has several severe drawbacks:

- If you create a service with client-side revision naming, you have to provide a new revision name on every update. This is especially tedious if using other clients than kn, like editing the resource directly in the cluster or you tools like the OpenShift Developer console. Assuming that kn is the only client to be used is a bit of a too bold attitude.
- `SinkBinding` [do not work with BYO revision names](https://github.com/knative/serving/issues/9544)
- `kn service apply` can't use client-generated revision names, so kn service apply ignore `--revision-name` option and always uses server-side generated revision names. The same is true if you want to use `kubectl apply` after you have created a service with BYO revision name mode with `kn`.
- Revision name's are random and do not reflect a certain generational order as for server-side generated revision names
- There are issues with new revision created when updated with the same image name again (see [#398](https://github.com/knative/client/issues/398#issuecomment-779654440))

Please refer to issue [#1144](https://github.com/knative/client/issues/1144) (and issues referencing this issue) for more details about the reasoning for this breaking change.

**ACTION REQUIRED**

If you rely on client-side revision naming, you have to add `--revision-name {{.Service}}-{{.Random 5}}-{{.Generation}}` to `kn service create` to get back the previous default behaviour. However, in most of all cases, you shound not worry about whether the revision names are created by `kn` or by the Knative serving controller.

In case of issues with this change, please let us know and we will fix it asap. We are committed to supporting you with any issues caused by this change.

#### üí´ New Features & Changes

- Options `--context` and `--cluster` allow you to select the parameters for connecting to your Kubernetes cluster. Those options work the same as for kubectl.
- Some cleanup of cluster-specific runtime information when doing a kn export.


### CLI Plugins

#### üí´ New Features & Changes

CLI `kn` [Plugins](https://github.com/knative/client/blob/master/docs/plugins/README.md) jump on the release train

With release v0.21, Knative ships also it first set of kn plugins, that are aligned with respect to their dependencies, so that they can be easily [inlined](https://github.com/knative/client/blob/master/docs/plugins/README.md#plugin-inlining).

The plugins included in version `v0.21` are:

- [kn-plugin-admin](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/kn-plugin-admin) for managing Knative installations that are running on Kubernetes | [download](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/kn-plugin-admin/releases/tag/v0.21.0)
- [kn-plugin-source-kafka](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/kn-plugin-source-kafka) for managing a Kafka Source that has been installed via [eventing-kafka](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/eventing-kafka) on the backend | [download](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/kn-plugin-source-kafka/releases/tag/v0.21.0)

To give those plugins a try, just download them and put the binary into your execution path. You then get help with kn admin --help and kn source kafka --help, respectively.

### Operator v0.21

#### üí´ New Features & Changes

The latest network ingress v0.21.0 artifacts, bundled within the image of this operator, include net-istio.yaml, net-contour.yaml and kourier.yaml.
