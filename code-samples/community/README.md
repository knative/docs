# Community code samples

Get up and running with one of the community code samples. These samples are
contributed and maintained by members of the Knative community.

!!! note
    These samples might become outdated or the original author might be unable
    to maintain their contribution. If you find that something isn't working,
    lend a helping hand and fix it in a PR.
