# Community code samples

Get up and running with one of the community code samples. These samples are
contributed and maintained by members of the Knative community.

**Note:** These samples might become outdated or the original author might be unable to maintain their contribution. If you find that something isn't working, lend a helping hand and fix it in a PR.
