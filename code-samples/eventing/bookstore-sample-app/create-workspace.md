## Setting Up a Webhook for Notifications

To set up a webhook for sending notifications to your Slack workspace:

- The page will give you a link associated with the app you created. This link will be where API requests are sent to send messages to your Slack workspace.

- To test if the webhook works as needed, you can try sending an API request to this link to see if the message goes through. I used Postman to test this. Remember that this is an application/json file.
