## Introduction

Knative is a Kubernetes-based platform to build, deploy, and manage modern serverless workloads.
See [Knative docs](https://github.com/knative/docs) for in-depth information about using Knative.

## Knative authors

Knative is an open source project with an active development community. 
The project was started by Google but has contriubtions from a growing number of
industry-leading companies. For a current list of the authors, see [Authors](https://github.com/knative/serving/blob/master/AUTHORS).

## Meetings and work groups

Knative has public and recorded bi-weekly community meetings.

Each project has one or more [working groups](WORKING-GROUPS.md) driving
the project, and Knative as a single [technical oversight community](TECH-OVERSIGHT-COMMITTEE.md)
monitoring the overall project.

## How can I help

If you're looking for something to do to get your feet wet working on Knative,
look for GitHub issues marked with the Help Wanted label:

*   [Serving issues](https://github.com/knative/serving/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22community%2Fhelp+wanted%22)
*   [Documentation repo](https://github.com/knative/docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22community%2Fhelp+wanted%22)

Even if there's not an issue opened for it, we can always use more
testing throughout the platform. Similarly, we can always use more docs, richer
docs, insightful docs. Or maybe a cool blog post? And if you're a web developer,
we could use your help in spiffing up our public-facing web site.
