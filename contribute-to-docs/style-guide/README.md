# Knative style guide

This folder contains the style guidelines for the Knative documentation.

You don't need to read the whole style guide before contributing to Knative documentation.
Unpolished contributions delivered early are better than perfect contributions delivered late.

If you notice gaps in the style guide or have queries, please post in [the #knative-documentation Slack channel](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C04LY5G9ED7).
