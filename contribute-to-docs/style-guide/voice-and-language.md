## Avoid statements about the future

Avoid making promises or giving hints about the future. If you need to talk
about a feature in development, add a boilerplate under the front matter that
identifies the information accordingly.

## Avoid statements that will soon be out of date

Avoid using wording that becomes outdated quickly like "currently" and
"new". A feature that is new today is not new for long.
