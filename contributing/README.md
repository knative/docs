## Introduction

Knative is a Kubernetes-based platform to build, deploy, and manage modern
serverless workloads. See [Knative docs](../docs/README.md) for in-depth
information about using Knative.

## Knative authors

Knative is an open source project with an active development community. The
project was started by Google but has contributions from a growing number of
industry-leading companies. For a current list of the authors, see
[Authors](https://github.com/knative/serving/blob/master/AUTHORS).

### Authoring samples

Beyond the official documentation there are endless possibilities for combining
tools, platforms, languages, and products. By submitting a tutorial you can
share your experience and help others who are solving similar problems.

Community tutorials are stored in Markdown files under the `community` folder
[Community Samples](../community/samples/README.md). These documents are
contributed, reviewed, and maintained by the community.

Submit a Pull Request to the community sample directory under the Knative
component folder that aligns with your document. For example, Knative Serving
samples are under the `serving` folder. A reviewer will be assigned to review
your submission. They'll work with you to ensure that your submission is clear,
correct, and meets the [style guide](./DOCS-CONTRIBUTING.md), but it helps if
you follow it as you write your tutorial.

## Meetings and work groups

Knative has public and recorded bi-weekly community meetings.

Each project has one or more [working groups](./WORKING-GROUPS.md) driving the
project, and Knative as a single
[technical oversight community](./TECH-OVERSIGHT-COMMITTEE.md) monitoring the
overall project.

## How can I help

If you're looking for something to do to get your feet wet working on Knative,
look for GitHub issues marked with the Help Wanted label:

- [Build issues](https://github.com/knative/build/labels/kind%2Fgood-first-issue)
- [Eventing issues](https://github.com/knative/eventing/labels/kind%2Fgood-first-issue)
- [Serving issues](https://github.com/knative/serving/labels/kind%2Fgood-first-issue)
- [Documentation repo](https://github.com/knative/docs/labels/kind%2Fgood-first-issue)

Even if there's not an issue opened for it, we can always use more testing
throughout the platform. Similarly, we can always use more docs, richer docs,
insightful docs. Or maybe a cool blog post? And if you're a web developer, we
could use your help in spiffing up our public-facing web site.
