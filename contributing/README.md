## Introduction

Knative is a Kubernetes-based platform to build, deploy, and manage modern
serverless workloads. See [Knative docs](https://github.com/knative/docs) for
in-depth information about using Knative.

## Knative authors

Knative is an open source project with an active development community. The
project was started by Google but has contributions from a growing number of
industry-leading companies. For a current list of the authors, see
[Authors](https://github.com/knative/serving/blob/master/AUTHORS).

### Authoring samples

Beyond the official documentation there are endless possibilities for combining
tools, platforms, languages, and products. By submitting a tutorial you can
share your experience and help others who are solving similar problems.

Community tutorials are stored in Markdown files on
[GitHub](../../community/samples/) where they can be reviewed and edited by the
community.

Please submit a Pull Request to the community sample directory under the
Knative component that your tutorial highlights -
[Serving](../../community/samples/serving/), [Eventing](../../community/samples/eventing/),
or [Build](../../community/samples/build/). A reviewer will be assigned to review your
submission. They'll work with you to ensure your submission meets the
[style guide](DOCS-CONTRIBUTING/), but it helps if you follow it as you
write your tutorial.

## Meetings and work groups

Knative has public and recorded bi-weekly community meetings.

Each project has one or more [working groups](WORKING-GROUPS/) driving the
project, and Knative as a single
[technical oversight community](TECH-OVERSIGHT-COMMITTEE/) monitoring the
overall project.

## How can I help

If you're looking for something to do to get your feet wet working on Knative,
look for GitHub issues marked with the Help Wanted label:

- [Serving issues](https://github.com/knative/serving/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22community%2Fhelp+wanted%22)
- [Documentation repo](https://github.com/knative/docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22community%2Fhelp+wanted%22)

Even if there's not an issue opened for it, we can always use more testing
throughout the platform. Similarly, we can always use more docs, richer docs,
insightful docs. Or maybe a cool blog post? And if you're a web developer, we
could use your help in spiffing up our public-facing web site.

## Questions and issues
