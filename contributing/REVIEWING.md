As a community, we believe in the value of code reviews for all contributions.
Code reviews increase both the quality and readability of our code base, which
in turn produces high quality software.

This document provides guidelines for how the project's
[Members](ROLES.md#member) review issues and merge pull requests (PRs).

- [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)

## Pull requests welcome

First and foremost: as a potential contributor, your changes and ideas are
welcome at any hour of the day or night, weekdays, weekends, and holidays.
Please do not ever hesitate to ask a question or submit a PR.

## Code of Conduct

Reviewers are often the first points of contact between new members of the
community and are important in shaping the community. We encourage reviewers to
read the [code of conduct](community/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) and to go above and
beyond the code of conduct to promote a collaborative and respectful community.

## Code reviewers

The code review process can introduce latency for contributors and additional
work for reviewers, frustrating both parties. Consequently, as a community we
expect all active participants to also be active reviewers. Participate in the
code review process in areas where you have expertise.

## Reviewing changes

Once a PR has been submitted, reviewers should do an initial review to do a
quick "triage" (e.g. close duplicates, identify user errors, etc.), and
potentially identify which maintainers should be the focal points for the
review.

If a PR is closed without accepting the changes, reviewers are expected to
provide sufficient feedback to the originator to explain why it is being closed.

During a review, PR authors are expected to respond to comments and questions
made within the PR - updating the proposed change as appropriate.

After a review of the proposed changes, reviewers can either approve or reject
the PR. To approve, they add an "approved" review to the PR. To reject, they add
a "request changes" review along with a full justification for why they are not
in favor of the change. If a PR gets a "request changes" vote, the group
discusses the issue to resolve their differences.

Reviewers are expected to respond in a timely fashion to PRs that are assigned
to them. Reviewers are expected to respond to _active_ PRs with reasonable
latency. If reviewers fail to respond, those PRs may be assigned to other
reviewers. _Active_ PRs are those that have a proper CLA (`cla:yes`) label, are
not works in progress (WIP), are passing tests, and do not need rebase to be
merged. PRs that do not have a proper CLA, are WIP, do not pass tests, or
require a rebase are not considered active PRs.

### Holds

Any [Approver](ROLES.md#approver) who wants to review a PR but does not have
time immediately can put a hold on a PR. If you need more time, say so on the PR
discussion and offer an ETA measured in single-digit days at most. Any PR that
has a hold will not be merged until the person who requested the hold acks the
review, withdraws their hold, or is overruled by a majority of approvers.

## Approvers

Merging of PRs is done by [Approvers](ROLES.md#approver).

As is the case with many open source projects, becoming an Approver is based on
contributions to the project. See our [community roles](ROLES.md) document for
information on how this is done.

## Merging PRs

A PR can be merged only after the following criteria are met:

1.  It has no "request changes" review from a reviewer.
1.  It has at least one "approved" review by at least one of the approvers of
    that repository.
1.  It has all appropriate corresponding documentation and tests.

## Prow

This project uses
[Prow](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow) to
automatically run tests for every PR. PRs with failing tests might not be
merged. If necessary, you can rerun the tests by simply adding the comment
`/retest` to your PR.

Prow has several other features that make PR management easier, like running the
go linter or assigning labels. For a full list of commands understood by Prow,
see the [command help page](https://prow.knative.dev/command-help).
