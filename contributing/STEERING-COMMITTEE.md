The Knative Steering Committee (KSC) is the ultimate authority for the Knative
project, and controls all aspects of the project or delegates its authority
to other committees.

KSC has delegated technical guidance for the project to the
[Technical Oversight Committee](./TECH-OVERSIGHT-COMMITTEE.md). However, the KSC
acts as the final escalation point for any and all decisions within the project.

## Committee Meetings

The Knative Steering Committee meets bi-weekly or as-needed.
Given the nature of the discussions in the committee, meetings are not generally
open the public. Questions around governance are listed as issues in the
[docs repo](https://github.com/knative/docs), and we invite your feedback there.

## Committee members

Seats on the Steering Committee are held by a company, not by the individual.

The current membership of the Steering committee is (listed alphabetically by name):

### Allocation of seats

Seats on the steering committee are allocated based upon contribution
to the project. No final decision has been made on the exact formula.
As the project continues to grow, we expect to add additional seats to the committee,
ensuring that those contributing to the project are properly represented.

At a minimum, seat allocation is reviewed once per year.

Members of the committee may step down at any time. When a member steps down, the
company who holds the seat shall nominate a new individual for the seat.

Changes to the number of seats, which company seats are allocated to, and nominations
to the committee are confirmed by majority vote of the committee members.

## Frequently asked questions

_Why are seats company held?_

The committee was created as the project was in its infancy, in order to tackle governance
and overall project strategy. Because of the nature of the project and funding required,
it was decided that strong corporate leadership was necessary for the project to ensure
velocity.

_What happens if someone leaves the company they represent?_

In that case, the company will nominate a new representative for the seat. The nominee
shall be confirmed by the standard process as called out above.

_What happens if someone leaves the project or decides to leave the committee?_

As above, the same would apply. The company who holds the seat will nominate a new
representative to hold the seat. The nominee shall be confirmed by the standard process,
called out above.

_Is this steering model permanent?_

The governance of Knative is an open, living document, and will continue to evolve as
the community and project change. We expect over time we will adapt the way we run this
committee, based on feedback from the community.

_How are steering committee decisions reached?_

The steering committee desires to always reach consensus. Decisions are made in
meetings when a quorum of the members are present and may pass with majority
vote. Quorum is considered reached when at least half of the members are present.

The committee's charter may be changed by majority consent of committee members.

In case of extended absence, an absent member will be considered to be in
agreement after eight days have passed since a proposal was accepted by all
present members. The company of the absent member may appoint a single delegate
from the same company, during absences.
