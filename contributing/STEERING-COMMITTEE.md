## Charter

1. Define, evolve, and defend the vision, values, mission, and scope of the project.
1. Define and evolve project governance structures and policies, including
   project roles and how collaborators become members, approvers, leads,
   and/or administrators. This includes policy for the creation and
   administration of [working groups](./WORKING-GROUPS.md) and committees.
1. Steward, control access, delegate access, and establishes processes regarding,
   all Knative project resources and has the final say in the disposition of
   those resources.
1. Manage the Knative brand and decide which things can be called "Knative" and
   how that mark can be used in relation to other efforts or vendors.
1. Confirm/reject nominations to the KSC from organizations who are allocated seats.
1. Confirm/reject nominations to the Technical Oversight Committee.
1. Receive and handle reports about [code of conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)
   violations and maintain confidentiality.
1. Receive security reports; work with the appropriate technical leads to
   accept or reject the report; maintain the private nature of such reports
   until disclosed to the broader community.
1. Act as the final escalation point and decider for any disputes, issues,
   clarifications, or escalations within the project scope.

## Delegated authority

KSC may choose to delegate its authority to other
committees as-needed. The committee currently recognizes this delegated authority
for:

- Technical guidance is delegated to the [Technical Oversight Committee](TECH-OVERSIGHT-COMMITTEE.md).

## Committee Meetings

KSC meets every two weeks or as-needed.

Given the private nature of many of these discussions (e.g. privacy, private
emails to the committee, code of conduct violations, escalations, disputes
between members, security reports, etc.) meetings are not generally
open the public.

Questions and proposals for changes to governance are posted as issues in the
[docs repo](https://github.com/knative/docs), and we invite your feedback there.

## Committee members

Seats on the Steering Committee are held by an organization, not by the individual.

The current membership of the Steering committee is (listed alphabetically by name):

| &nbsp;                                                   | Member         | Organization | Profile                                  |

|   | TBD | IBM      |        |
|   | TBD | Pivotal  |        |
|   | TBD | Red Hat  |        |

There are currently four unfilled seats, as indicated by TBD.

### Allocation of seats

Seats on the steering committee are allocated based upon contribution
to the project by an organization. No final decision has been made on the exact
formula.

As the project continues to grow, we expect to add additional seats to the
committee, ensuring that those contributing to the project are properly
represented. At a minimum, seat allocation is reviewed once per year.

- After a seat is allocated to an organization, the organization shall nominate
  a candidate to be confirmed by KSC. The committee reserves the right to not
  confirm a candidate, in which the organization would need to nominate a new
  candidate
- Members of the committee may step down at any time. When a member steps down,
  their organization shall nominate a new candidate.
- If an organization is unable to seat a candidate, the KSC reserves the right
  to reallocate the seat to another organization.
- Changes to the number of seats, which company seats are allocated to, and
  nominations to the committee are confirmed by majority vote of the committee
  members.
- In situations where the organization which holds a seat is no longer a viable
  entity (e.g. merger, dissolution, bankruptcy) the KSC will make a decision on
  how to reallocate that seat. Seats do not automatically transfer to any 
  organization.

## Clarifications

_Why are seats company held?_

The committee was created as the project was in its infancy, in order to tackle governance
and overall project strategy. Because of the nature of the project and funding required,
it was decided that strong corporate leadership was necessary for the project to ensure
velocity.

_What happens if someone leaves the company they represent?_

In that case, the company will nominate a new representative for the seat. The nominee
shall be confirmed by the standard process as called out above.

_What happens if someone leaves the project or decides to leave the committee?_

As above, the same would apply. The company who holds the seat will nominate a new
representative to hold the seat. The nominee shall be confirmed by the standard process,
called out above.

_Is this steering model permanent?_

The governance of Knative is an open, living document, and will continue to evolve as
the community and project change. We expect over time we will adapt the way we run this
committee, based on feedback from the community.

_How are steering committee decisions reached?_

The steering committee desires to always reach consensus. Decisions are made in
meetings when a quorum of the members are present and may pass with majority
of the committee supporting it. Quorum is considered reached when at least half
of the members are present.

The committee's charter may be changed by majority consent of committee members.

In case of extended absence, an absent member will be considered to be in
agreement after eight days have passed since a proposal was accepted by all
present members. The company of the absent member may appoint a single delegate
from the same company, during absences.
