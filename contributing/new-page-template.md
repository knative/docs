This guide shows you how to do something very cool. Make sure to include
a value proposition for the user: for example, this guide shows you how to do X,
which is useful for doing Y and Z. Make sure you answer the questions "what does
this guide show you how to do?" and "why would someone want to do this?".

## Before you begin

You need:

- A Kubernetes cluster with [Knative installed](../install/README.md). <!-- Update this relative link as needed, depending on where the new page is located in the file structure. -->
- Anything else?

## Break steps into logical sections

Avoid nesting headings directly on top of each other with no text inbetween.

### You can use smaller sections within sections for related tasks

Avoid nesting headings directly on top of each other with no text inbetween.

## Cleaning up

If your guide installs a sample application, show the user how to delete it.

## What's next

Provide relative links to other relevant topics, if applicable. Once someone has
completed these steps, what might they want to do next?
