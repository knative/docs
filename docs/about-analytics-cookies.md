## What are cookies?

[Cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) are small pieces of data that is sent from a
website and stored on the user's computer by the user's web browser while that user is browsing.
Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember stateful information
or to record the user's browsing activity.

For example, a cookie can be used to determine if a user has already visited a page and whether or
not that user has already been presented with a certain notice or announcement. As a rule, cookies
will make your browsing experience better, like ensuring that those same notices or announcements
don't pop-up over every page.

Many sites use cookies and analytics. You might have agreed to their usage when you created an
account, used their service, or viewed their webpage (cookie consent notice).

However, you can choose to disable cookies on knative.dev, or any other website. The most
effective way to do this is to disable cookies in your browser but you can loose some website
behavior.

We also learn about what types of content and topic areas you
