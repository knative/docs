There is no longer 120 hours over 37 days of non-code compliance work standing in the way of production. Thousands of PNC software developers have seen their deployment window shrink to near real time. Our teams achieve true continuous delivery. That is our big win.”

PNC sought to develop a way to ensure new code would meet security standards and audit compliance requirements automatically—replacing the cumbersome 30-day manual process they had in place.
