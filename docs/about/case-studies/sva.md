<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">SVA uses Knative to kickstart cloud native adoption and patterns</h2>

SVA System Vertrieb Alexander GmbH is a leading German company that specializes in Professional Services, server migrations, and managed services. Public sectors pose unique challenges due to their complex structure and regulated requirements. For example, one particular customer, a German government organisation, is divided into departments, groups, units, and application teams, each with specific functional responsibilities. Some applications have to adhere to specific laws, which limits innovation and makes the lifecycle of applications stale. With the gradual introduction of microservices and service-oriented architecture, the number of applications connecting to each other grew into a complicated mesh of applications which was quickly becoming unmanageable.
