# Collecting Metrics with OpenTelemetry

This document describes how to set up the
[OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) to receive
metrics from the Knative infrastructure components and distribute them to
Prometheus. [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is a CNCF an
observability framework for cloud-native software. The project provides a
collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs. You use it to instrument, generate,
collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) for analysis in
order to understand your software's performance and behavior. OpenTelemetry
allows Knative to build provider-agnostic instrumentation into the platform, so
that it's easy to export metrics to multiple monitoring services without
needing to rebuild or reconfigure the Knative binaries.

## Setting up the collector

The collector provides a long-lived location where various Knative components
can push metrics (and eventually traces) to be retained and collected by a
monitoring service. For this example, we'll configure a single collector
instance using a ConfigMap and a Deployment. For more complex deployments, some
of this can be automated using the
[opentelemetry-operator](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator),
but it's also easy to manage this service directly. Note that you can attach
other components (node agents, other services); this is just a simple sample.

1. First, create a namespace for the collector to run in:

   ```shell
   kubectl create namespace metrics
   ```

1. And then create a Deployment, Service, and ConfigMap for the collector:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply --filename https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knative/docs/master/docs/install/collecting-metrics/collector.yaml
   ```

1. Finally, update the `config-observability` ConfigMap in Knative Serving and
   Eventing
   ```shell
   kubectl patch --namespace knative-serving configmap/config-observability \
     --type merge \
     --patch '{"data":{"metrics.backend-destination":"opencensus","request-metrics-backend-destination":"opencensus","metrics.opencensus-address":"otel-collector.metrics:55678"}}'
   kubectl patch --namespace knative-eventing configmap/config-observability \
     --type merge \
     --patch '{"data":{"metrics.backend-destination":"opencensus","metrics.opencensus-address":"otel-collector.metrics:55678"}}'
   ```

You can check that metrics are being forwarded by loading the Prometheus export
port on the collector:

```shell
kubectl port-forward --namespace metrics deployment/otel-collector 8889
```

And then fetch http://localhost:8889/metrics to see the exported metrics.

## Setting up Prometheus

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is an open-source tool for collecting and
aggregating timeseries metrics. Full configuration of Prometheus can be found at
the website, but this document will provide a simple setup for scraping the
OpenTelemetry Collector we set up in the previous section.

1. Install the
   [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator).
   Note that the provided manifest installs the operator into the `default`
   namespace. If you want to install into another namespace, you'll need to
   download the YAML manifest and update all the namespace references to your
   target namespace.

   ```shell
   kubectl apply --filename https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/master/bundle.yaml
   ```

1. You'll then need to set up a ServiceMonitor object to track the OpenTelemetry
   Collector, as well as a ServiceAccount with the ability to read Kubernetes
   services and pods (so that Prometheus can track the resource endpoints) and
   finally a Prometheus object to instantiate the actual Prometheus instance.

   ```shell
   kubectl apply --filename prometheus.yaml
   ```

By default, the Prometheus instance will only be exposed on a private service
named `prometheus-operated`; to access the console in your web browser, run:

```shell
kubectl port-forward --namespace metrics service/prometheus-operated 9090
```

And then access the console in your browser via http://localhost:9090.
