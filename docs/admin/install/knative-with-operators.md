# Knative Operator installation

Knative provides a [Kubernetes Operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) to install, configure and manage Knative.
You can install the Serving component, Eventing component, or both on your cluster.

!!! warning
    The Knative Operator is still in Alpha phase. It has not been tested in a production environment, and should be used for development or test purposes only.

--8<-- "prerequisites.md"

## Installing the latest release

You can find information about the different released versions of the Knative Operator on the [Releases page](https://github.com/knative/operator/releases).

Install the latest stable Operator release:

```
kubectl apply -f {{artifact(org="knative",repo="operator",file="operator.yaml" )}}
```

## Verify your installation

Verify your installation:

```
kubectl get deployment knative-operator
```

If the operator is installed correctly, the deployment shows a `Ready` status:

```
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
knative-operator   1/1     1            1           19h
```

## Track the log

Track the log of the operator:

```
kubectl logs -f deploy/knative-operator
```

## Installing the Knative Serving component

### Create and apply the Knative Serving CR:

!!! note "Install Current Serving"

    === "Install Current Serving (default)"

        You can install the latest available Knative Serving in the
        operator by applying a YAML file containing the following:

        ```
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Namespace
        metadata:
        name: knative-serving
        ---
        apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1
        kind: KnativeServing
        metadata:
          name: knative-serving
          namespace: knative-serving
        ```

        If you do not specify a version by using spec_version, the operator defaults to the latest available version.

    === "Install Future Knative Serving"

        You do not need to upgrade the operator to a newer version to install
        new releases of Knative Serving. If Knative Serving launches a new version, e.g. `$spec_version`, you can install it by
        applying a YAML file containing the following:

        ```
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Namespace
        metadata:
        name: knative-serving
        ---
        apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1
        kind: KnativeServing
        metadata:
          name: knative-serving
          namespace: knative-serving
        spec:
          version: $spec_version
          manifests:
            - URL: https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v${VERSION}/serving-core.yaml
            - URL: https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v${VERSION}/serving-hpa.yaml
            - URL: https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v${VERSION}/serving-post-install-jobs.yaml
            - URL: https://github.com/knative/net-istio/releases/download/v${VERSION}/net-istio.yaml
        ```

        The field `$spec_version` is used to set the version of Knative Serving. Replace `$spec_version` with the correct version number.
        The tag `${VERSION}` is automatically replaced with the version number from `spec_version` by the operator.

        The field `spec.manifests` is used to specify one or multiple URL links of Knative Serving component. Do not forget to
        add the valid URL of the Knative network ingress plugin. Knative Serving component is still tightly-coupled with a network
        ingress plugin in the operator. As in the above example, you can use `net-istio`. The ordering of the URLs is critical.
        Put the manifest you want to apply first on the top.

    === "Install Customized Knative Serving"

        The operator provides you the flexibility to install customized
        Knative Serving based your own requirements. As long as the manifests of customized Knative Serving are accessible to
        the operator, they can be installed.

        There are two modes available for you to install the customized manifests: overwrite mode and append mode. With the
        overwrite mode, you need to define all the manifests for Knative Serving to install, because the operator will no long
        install any available default manifests. With the append mode, you only need to define your customized manifests, and
        the customized manifests are installed, after default manifests are applied.

        1. You can use the overwrite mode to customize all the Knative Serving manifests. For example, the version of the customized
        Knative Serving is `$spec_version`, and it is available at `https://my-serving/serving.yaml`. You choose `net-istio`
        as the ingress plugin, which is available at `https://my-net-istio/net-istio.yaml`. You can create the content of Serving
        CR as below to install your Knative Serving and the istio ingress:
        ```
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Namespace
        metadata:
        name: knative-serving
        ---
        apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1
        kind: KnativeServing
        metadata:
          name: knative-serving
          namespace: knative-serving
        spec:
          version: $spec_version
          manifests:
            - URL: https://my-serving/serving.yaml
            - URL: https://my-net-istio/net-istio.yaml
        ```

        You can make the customized Knative Serving available in one or multiple links, as the `spec.manifests` supports a list
        of links. The ordering of the URLs is critical. Put the manifest you want to apply first on the top. We strongly recommend
        you to specify the version and the valid links to the customized Knative Serving, by leveraging both `spec_version`
        and `spec.manifests`. Do not skip either field.

        1. You can use the append mode to add your customized manifests into the default manifests. For example, you only customize
        a few resources, and make them available at `https://my-serving/serving-custom.yaml`. You still need to install the default
        Knative Serving. In this case, you can create the content of Serving CR as below:
        ```
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Namespace
        metadata:
        name: knative-serving
        ---
        apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1
        kind: KnativeServing
        metadata:
          name: knative-serving
          namespace: knative-serving
        spec:
          version: $spec_version
          additionalManifests:
            - URL: https://my-serving/serving-custom.yaml
        ```

        Knative operator will install the default manifests of Knative Serving at the version `$spec_version`, and then install
        your customized manifests based on them.

### Verify the Knative Serving deployment:

1. Monitor the Knative deployments:
```
kubectl get deployment -n knative-serving
```
If Knative Serving has been successfully deployed, all deployments of the Knative Serving will show `READY` status. Here
is a sample output:
```
NAME                   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
activator              1/1     1            1           18s
autoscaler             1/1     1            1           18s
autoscaler-hpa         1/1     1            1           14s
controller             1/1     1            1           18s
net-istio-webhook      1/1     1            1           12s
net-istio-controller   1/1     1            1           12s
webhook                1/1     1            1           17s
```

1. Check the status of Knative Serving Custom Resource:
```
kubectl get KnativeServing knative-serving -n knative-serving
```
If Knative Serving is successfully installed, you should see:
```
NAME              VERSION             READY   REASON
knative-serving   <version number>    True
```

### Installing with Different Networking Layers

??? "Installing the Knative Serving component with different network layers"

    Knative Operator can configure Knative Serving component with different network layer options. Istio is the default network
    layer, if the ingress is not specified in the Knative Serving CR. Click on each tab below to see how you can configure
    Knative Serving with different ingresses:

    === "Ambassador"

        The following commands install Ambassador and enable its Knative integration.

        1. Create a namespace to install Ambassador in:

## Installing the Knative Eventing component

1. Create and apply the Knative Eventing CR:

    You can install the latest available Knative Eventing in the
    operator by applying a YAML file containing the following:

    === "Install Current Evenintg (default)"

        ```
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Namespace
        metadata:
        name: knative-eventing
        ---
        apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1
        kind: KnativeEventing
        metadata:
          name: knative-eventing
          namespace: knative-eventing
        ```

        If you do not specify a version by using spec.version, the operator defaults to the latest available version.

    === "Install Future Knative Eventing"

        You do not need to upgrade the operator to a newer version to install
        new releases of Knative Eventing. If Knative Eventing launches a new version, e.g. `$spec_version`, you can install it by
        applying a YAML file containing the following:

        ```
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Namespace
        metadata:
        name: knative-eventing
        ---
        apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1
        kind: KnativeEventing
        metadata:
          name: knative-eventing
          namespace: knative-eventing
        spec:
          version: $spec_version
          manifests:
            - URL: https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases/download/v${VERSION}/eventing.yaml
            - URL: https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases/download/v${VERSION}/eventing-post-install-jobs.yaml
        ```

        The field `spec.version` is used to set the version of Knative Eventing. Replace `$spec_version` with the correct version number.
        The tag `${VERSION}` is automatically replaced with the version number from `spec.version` by the operator.

        The field `spec.manifests` is used to specify one or multiple URL links of Knative Eventing component. Do not forget to
        add the valid URL of the Knative network ingress plugin. The ordering of the URLs is critical. Put the manifest you want
        to apply first on the top.

    === "Install Customized Knative Evening"

        The operator provides you the flexibility to install customized
        Knative Eventing based your own requirements. As long as the manifests of customized Knative Eventing are accessible to
        the operator, they can be installed.

        There are two modes available for you to install the customized manifests: overwrite mode and append mode. With the
        overwrite mode, you need to define all the manifests for Knative Eventing to install, because the operator will no long
        install any available default manifests. With the append mode, you only need to define your customized manifests, and
        the customized manifests are installed, after default manifests are applied.

        1. You can use the overwrite mode to customize all the Knative Eventing manifests. For example, the version of the customized
          Knative Eventing is `$spec_version`, and it is available at `https://my-eventing/eventing.yaml`. You can create the
          content of Eventing CR as below to install your Knative Eventing:

        ```
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Namespace
        metadata:
        name: knative-eventing
        ---
        apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1
        kind: KnativeEventing
        metadata:
          name: knative-eventing
          namespace: knative-eventing
        spec:
          version: $spec_version
          manifests:
            - URL: https://my-eventing/eventing.yaml
        ```

        You can make the customized Knative Eventing available in one or multiple links, as the `spec.manifests` supports a list
        of links. The ordering of the URLs is critical. Put the manifest you want to apply first on the top. We strongly recommend
        you to specify the version and the valid links to the customized Knative Eventing, by leveraging both `spec.version`
        and `spec.manifests`. Do not skip either field.

        1. You can use the append mode to add your customized manifests into the default manifests. For example, you only customize
          a few resources, and make them available at `https://my-eventing/eventing-custom.yaml`. You still need to install the default
          Knative eventing. In this case, you can create the content of Eventing CR as below:

        ```
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Namespace
        metadata:
        name: knative-eventing
        ---
        apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1
        kind: KnativeEventing
        metadata:
          name: knative-eventing
          namespace: knative-eventing
        spec:
          version: $spec_version
          additionalManifests:
            - URL: https://my-eventing/eventing-custom.yaml
        ```

        Knative operator will install the default manifests of Knative Eventing at the version `$spec_version`, and then install
        your customized manifests based on them.

### Verify the Knative Eventing deployment:

```
kubectl get deployment -n knative-eventing
```

If Knative Eventing has been successfully deployed, all deployments of the Knative Eventing will show `READY` status. Here
is a sample output:

```
NAME                  READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
broker-controller      1/1     1            1           63s
broker-filter          1/1     1            1           62s
broker-ingress         1/1     1            1           62s
eventing-controller    1/1     1            1           67s

mt-broker-controller   1/1     1            1           62s
```

### Check the status of Knative Eventing Custom Resource:

```
kubectl get KnativeEventing knative-eventing -n knative-eventing
```

If Knative Eventing is successfully installed, you should see:

```
NAME               VERSION             READY   REASON
knative-eventing   <version number>    True
```

### Installing with different eventing sources

## Uninstall Knative

### Removing the Knative Serving component

Remove the Knative Serving CR:

```
kubectl delete KnativeServing knative-serving -n knative-serving
```

### Removing Knative Eventing component

Remove the Knative Eventing CR:

```
kubectl delete KnativeEventing knative-eventing -n knative-eventing
```

Knative operator prevents unsafe removal of Knative resources. Even if the Knative Serving and Knative Eventing CRs are
successfully removed, all the CRDs in Knative are still kept in the cluster. All your resources relying on Knative CRDs
can still work.

### Removing the Knative Operator:

If you have installed Knative using the Release page, remove the operator using the following command:

```
kubectl delete -f {{artifact(org="knative",repo="operator",file="operator.yaml")}}
```

If you have installed Knative from source, uninstall it using the following command while in the root directory
for the source:

```
ko delete -f config/
```
