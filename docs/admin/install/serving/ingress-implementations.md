# Unofficial ingress implementations

In addition to the Knative ingress implementations in the ([install a networking layer](../install-serving-with-yaml/#install-a-networking-layer)) section, there are other Knative ingress implementations.

Here is the list of the ingress implementations (alphabetically):

- [Emissary ingress (Ambassador API Gateway)](https://www.getambassador.io/docs/edge-stack/latest/howtos/knative/): Emissary ingress is an open-source Kubernetes-native API Gateway + Layer 7 load balancer + Kubernetes ingress built on Envoy Proxy.
- [Kong](https://docs.konghq.com/kubernetes-ingress-controller/latest/guides/using-kong-with-knative/): Kong is an open source API Gateway built for hybrid and multi-cloud environments.

These implementations are not officially supported by Knative community at this moment, but the implementation will be added to the main guide once it is ready for general use.
