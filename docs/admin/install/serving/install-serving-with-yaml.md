    !!! tip
        For a detailed guide on Gloo integration, see
        [Installing Gloo for Knative](https://docs.solo.io/gloo/latest/installation/knative/)
        in the Gloo documentation.

    The following commands install Gloo and enable its Knative integration.

    1. Ensure `glooctl` is installed by running the command:

        glooctl version
        ```

        v1.3.x or later is recommended.
        If it is not installed, you can install the latest version by running the command:
        ```bash
        curl -sL https://run.solo.io/gloo/install | sh
        export PATH=$HOME/.gloo/bin:$PATH
        ```

        or by following the

## Verify the installation

!!! success
    Monitor the Knative components until all of the components display `Running` or
    `Completed` beneath `STATUS`:

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods --namespace knative-serving
    ```


## Configure DNS

You can configure DNS to prevent the need to run curl commands with a host header.

The tabs below expand to show instructions for configuring DNS.
Follow the procedure for the DNS of your choice:

<!-- This indentation is important for things to render properly. -->

=== "Magic DNS (xip.io)"

    If the cluster LoadBalancer service doesn't expose an IPv4 address or hostname, such as with
    IPv6 clusters or local setups such as minikube, Magic DNS won't work.
    Follow the Real DNS or Temporary DNS steps instead.

    * If the cluster LoadBalancer service exposes an IPv4 address or hostname, use a simple
    Kubernetes Job called `serving-default-domain` that configures Knative Serving to use
    [xip.io](http://xip.io) as the default DNS suffix by running the command:

        ```bash
        kubectl apply -f {{ artifact(repo="serving",file="serving-default-domain.yaml")}}
        ```


=== "Real DNS"

    To configure DNS for Knative, take the External IP address
    or CNAME from setting up networking, and configure it with your DNS provider as
    follows:

    1. If the networking layer produced an External IP address, then configure a
      wildcard `A` record for the domain by running the command:

        ```bash
        *.<domain-suffix> == A 35.233.41.212
        ```
        Where `<domain-suffix>` is the domain suffix for your cluster

    1. If the networking layer produced a CNAME, then configure a CNAME record for the domain by running the command:

        ```bash
        *.<domain-suffix> == CNAME a317a278525d111e89f272a164fd35fb-1510370581.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com
        ```
        Where `<domain-suffix>` is the domain suffix for your cluster

    1. After your DNS provider is configured, direct Knative to use that domain by running the command:

        ```bash
        kubectl patch configmap/config-domain \
          --namespace knative-serving \
          --type merge \
          --patch '{"data":{"<domain-suffix>":""}}'
        ```
        Where `<domain-suffix>` is the domain suffix for your cluster

=== "Temporary DNS"

    If you are using curl to access the sample applications or your own Knative app, and are
    unable to use the Magic DNS (xip.io) or Real DNS methods, you can use a temporary approach.

    See the Real DNS method for a permanent solution.

    Temporary DNS is useful for evaluating Knative without altering the DNS configuration, as in the
    Real DNS method, or cannot use the Magic DNS method due to using, for example, minikube locally
    or IPv6 clusters.

    To access your application using curl using this method:

    1. After starting your application, get the URL of your application by running the command:

        ```bash
        kubectl get ksvc
        ```

        !!! success "Verify the output"

            ```bash
            NAME            URL                                        LATESTCREATED         LATESTREADY           READY   REASON
            helloworld-go   http://helloworld-go.default.example.com   helloworld-go-vqjlf   helloworld-go-vqjlf   True
            ```

    1. Instruct curl to connect to the External IP address or CNAME defined by the
      networking layer in section 3 above, and use the `-H "Host:"` command-line
      option to specify the Knative application's hostname.

      For example, if the networking layer defines your External IP address and port to be
      `http://192.168.39.228:32198` and you wish to access the above `helloworld-go` application,
      run the command:

        ```bash
        curl -H "Host: helloworld-go.default.example.com" http://192.168.39.228:32198
        ```

        !!! success "Verify the output"
            In the case of the provided `helloworld-go` sample application, when using the default configuration the output is:

            ```
            Hello Go Sample v1!
            ```

## Install optional Serving extensions

The tabs below expand to show instructions for installing each Serving extension.

=== "HPA autoscaling"

    Knative also supports the use of the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
    for driving autoscaling decisions.

    * Install the components needed to support HPA-class autoscaling by running the command:

        ```bash
        kubectl apply -f {{ artifact(repo="serving",file="serving-hpa.yaml")}}
        ```

    <!-- TODO(https://github.com/knative/docs/issues/2152): Link to a more in-depth guide on HPA-class autoscaling -->

=== "TLS with cert-manager"

    Knative supports automatically provisioning TLS certificates through
    [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/). The following commands
    install the components needed to support the provisioning of TLS certificates
    through cert-manager.

    1. Install [cert-manager version v1.0.0 or later](../../../../serving/installing-cert-manager).

    1. Install the component that integrates Knative with `cert-manager` by running the command:

        ```bash
        kubectl apply -f {{ artifact(repo="net-certmanager",file="release.yaml")}}
        ```

    1. Configure Knative to automatically configure TLS certificates by following the steps in
    [Enabling automatic TLS certificate provisioning](../../../../serving/using-auto-tls).

=== "TLS with HTTP01"

    Knative supports automatically provisioning TLS certificates using Encrypt HTTP01 challenges. The following commands install the components needed to support TLS.

    1. Install the net-http01 controller by running the command:

        ```bash
        kubectl apply -f {{ artifact(repo="net-http01",file="release.yaml")}}
        ```

    2. Configure the `certificate.class` to use this certificate type by running the command:

        ```bash
        kubectl patch configmap/config-network \
          --namespace knative-serving \
          --type merge \
          --patch '{"data":{"certificate.class":"net-http01.certificate.networking.knative.dev"}}'
        ```

    3. Enable auto-TLS by running the command:

        ```bash
        kubectl patch configmap/config-network \
          --namespace knative-serving \
          --type merge \
          --patch '{"data":{"autoTLS":"Enabled"}}'
        ```


=== "TLS wildcard support"

    !!! warning
        TLS wildcard support does not work with HTTP01.

    If you are using a certificate implementation that supports provisioning
    wildcard certificates (for example, cert-manager with a DNS01 issuer) then the most
    efficient way to provision certificates is with the namespace wildcard
    certificate controller.

    * Install the components needed to provision wildcard certificates in each namespace by running the command:

        ```bash
        kubectl apply -f {{ artifact(repo="serving",file="serving-nscert.yaml")}}
        ```


=== "DomainMapping CRD"

    The DomainMapping CRD allows a user to map a domain name that they own to a specific Knative Service.

    * Apply the DomainMapping CRD by running the commands:

        ```bash
        kubectl apply -f {{ artifact(repo="serving",file="serving-domainmapping-crds.yaml")}}
        kubectl apply -f {{ artifact(repo="serving",file="serving-domainmapping.yaml")}}
        ```
