Knative benefits are clear and the potential is huge. For organizations using Kubernetes, adding Knative simplifies, automates, and monitors K8s deployments so teams spend less time on maintenance and more time on app development and projects. Knative takes over repetitive and time-intensive tasks while removing obstacles and delays.


**Now part of CNCF, Knative helps you:**


- Seamlessly incorporate container-based serverless for your Kubernetes workloads, including scale to zero
- Set up detailed actions triggered by specific events within a broader environment
- Match cloud velocity with your on-premises workloads


Today, only a small percent of Kubernetes users are taking advantage of Knative, according to a recent [CNCF survey](https://github.com/cncf/surveys/tree/main/cloudnative).
