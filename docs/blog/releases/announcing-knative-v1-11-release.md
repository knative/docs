A new version of Knative is now available across multiple components.

Follow the instructions in [Installing Knative](https://knative.dev/docs/install/) to install the components you require.

This release brings a number of smaller improvements to the core Knative Serving and Eventing components, and several improvements to specific plugins.

- [Eventing](#eventing)
- [`kn` CLI](#client)
- [Functions](#functions)
- [Knative Operator](#operator)

## Serving

[Release Notes](https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/tag/knative-v1.11.0)

### üö® Breaking or Notable
- Activator uses TLS 1.3 as the minimum version when internal encryption is activated for communication with queue-proxy (#13887, @izabelacg)
- Domain mapping controller logic is now merged with the Serving controller. Domainmapping webhook is merged with the Serving webhook. (#14082, @skonto)
- DomainMapping/v1alpha1 is deprecated - use v1beta1 APIs (#14058, @dprotaso)

### üí´ New Features & Changes
- A new flag is introduced `queueproxy.resource-defaults` that sets resource requests, limits for Queue Proxy when enabled (applies only to cpu and memory). (#14039, @skonto)
- Activator now has a separate service account, reducing its privileges to the required minimum. (#14133, @davidhadas)
- Queue proxy resources can be configured via annotations at the service level.  The resource percentage annotation is now deprecated. (#14038, @skonto)
- Sets DefaultDomain to cluster's domain instead of hardcoded `svc.cluster.local` (#13964, @kauana)


### üêûBug Fixes
- Autoscaler metric are validated with global autoscaling class if no class annotation is set. (#13978, @xtreme-vikram-yadav)
- Drop `cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict` annotations on our control plane to allow nodes to drain (#14035, @dprotaso)
- Fix activator load balancing when using unbounded concurrency and when you have two instances of a revision (#14028, @dprotaso)
- Queue proxy metrics reporting period is now supported for both prometheus and opencensus.
  This allows fine-grained control of how often metrics are exported via a new config map attribute. (#14019, @skonto)
- Tag to digest min TLS version is 1.2 and can be configured higher using the controller environment variable `TAG_TO_DIGEST_TLS_MIN_VERSION` and supports values `"1.2"` and `"1.3"` (#13962, @dprotaso)

## Eventing

[Release Notes](https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases/tag/knative-v1.11.0)

- ApiServerSource supports sending events to TLS endpoints, minimum TLS version is v1.2 (#6956, @pierDipi)
- ContainerSource supports sending events to TLS endpoints, minimum TLS version is v1.2 (#6957, @vishal-chdhry)
- Even Type auto-create feature:
  - Based on CloudEvents processed in an inmemorychannel corresponding `EventType` resources are created in the namespace (#7089, @Cali0707)
  - Feature flag to enable: `eventtype-auto-create` in `configmap/config-features`
  - Based on CloudEvents processed in a broker corresponding `EventType` resources are created in the namespace (#7034, @dsimansk)
- EventType v1b2 on sources `duck` controller/reconciler used (#6962, @matzew)
- EventType v1beta2 usage on the reconciler (#6949, @matzew)
- Do not parse flags in InitializeEventingFlags (#6966, @mgencur)
- PingSource supports sending events to TLS endpoints, minimum TLS version is v1.2 (#6965, @pierDipi)
- Source duck compliant source now create EventTypes for KResources, not just brokers (#7032, @matzew)
- The ApiServerSource controller now sets the K_CA_CERTS environment variable when creating the adapter and the sink has CACerts defined. (#6897, @vishal-chdhry)
- The ApiServerSource controller now sets the K_CA_CERTS environment variable when creating the adapter and the sink has CACerts defined. (#6920, @vishal-chdhry)
- The BROKER field of the EventType is deprecated, and is replaced by a KRef reference, pointing to the broker. In the future Knative will be able to support other addressables with EventType, instead of just a broker (#6870, @matzew)
- The EventType CRD can now point to other resources, like channels or sinks (#7023, @matzew)
