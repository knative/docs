## Serving

[Release Notes](https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/tag/knative-v1.6.0)

### 💫 New Features & Changes

* The `HTTPRedirect` feature is stable and the feature flag has been removed. This feature enabled use of the `networking.knative.dev/httpOption` annotation to configure HTTP -> HTTPS redirect on a per-service basis. [#13084](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/13084)
* The Serving API no longer rejects unknown fields, and instead relies on the kubernetes apiserver to prune (remove) those fields. [#13095](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/13095), [#13111](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/13111)

## Eventing

[Release Notes](https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases/tag/knative-v1.6.0)

### 🐞 Bug Fixes

### RabbitMQ Broker and Source

#### Breaking Changes

* Some deprecated fine-grained configuration options have been removed from RabbitMQSource. [#800](https://github.com/knative-extensions/eventing-rabbitmq/pull/800)
* RabbitMQSource now uses a RabbitCluster reference like the Broker. [#801](https://github.com/knative-extensions/eventing-rabbitmq/pull/801)
* RabbitMQSource parameters have been re-arranged into logical groups. [#810](https://github.com/knative-extensions/eventing-rabbitmq/pull/810)

#### 💫 New Features & Changes

* Message pre-fetch is now automatically set to 100, increasing steady-state throughput. [#856](https://github.com/knative-extensions/eventing-rabbitmq/pull/856)
* Added the ability to configure queue types in RabbitmqBrokerConfig. [#808](https://github.com/knative-extensions/eventing-rabbitmq/pull/803)
