title: TOC 2021 election announcement

Itâ€™s time to kick off the Knative [Technical Oversight Committee](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/main/TECH-OVERSIGHT-COMMITTEE.md) (TOC) elections
again for 2021, and we are ready to accept nominations!

This election will shape the future of Knative as a community and project. While
WGs help shape the individual direction of the project, the [TOC](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/main/TECH-OVERSIGHT-COMMITTEE.md#charter) covers the
technical direction, health of the project and community as a whole. There are 2
seats up for election and each of those seats will be held for two year terms.

Right now, there are 2 things we need each Knative community member to do:

1) If you want to stand for election, we have [detailed instructions for the
nomination
process](https://github.com/knative/community/tree/main/elections/2021-TOC#candidacy-process).
2) If
you want to vote in the election, please read the [eligibility
criteria](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/main/mechanics/TOC.md#voter-eligibility). If you think you are eligible to vote, please check the Elekto application to see if you are eligible, and if not, [request a voter exception](https://test.elekto.io/app/elections/2021-TOC/exception).  See the [voter guide](https://github.com/knative/community/tree/main/elections/2021-TOC) for more information on how voting works.

Here are a few important deadlines to keep in mind:

- April 23: All candidate nominations
- April 27: Election Begins
- May 9: Voter exception requests due
- May 11: Election Closes
- May 13: Announcement of Results

For this election, we will be trying a new voting tool called [Elekto](https://github.com/elekto-io/elekto).
Commissioned by the CNCF for the Kubernetes project, Elekto has the advantage of
not requiring any email for voting, just your Github login.  However, this will
be the first time a project other than Kubernetes is using Elekto, so please be
prepared for some hiccups.

For more details, please visit the [TOC election](
https://github.com/knative/community/tree/main/elections/2021-TOC) document in
our GitHub repository, and if you have questions for us, please reach out
by emailing elections@knative.team.

Dawn Foster and Josh Berkus, TOC Election Officers
