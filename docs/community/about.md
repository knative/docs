# About the Knative community

This page provides links to documents for common Knative community practices and
a description of Knative's audience.

At the moment, these practices (except for the formation of Working Groups and Lazy Consensus) are recommendations that individual working groups can choose to adopt, rather than requirements. Each working group should document their processes; either in their own repo or in a pointer to these docs.

## Community values

- [Knative project values](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/main/VALUES.md):

## Community Calendar

The [Knative community calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=knative.team_9q83bg07qs5b9rrslp5jor4l6s%40group.calendar.google.com) ([iCal export file](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/knative.team_9q83bg07qs5b9rrslp5jor4l6s%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics))
contains events, such as working group meetings and meetups, that provide the opportunity to learn more about Knative and meet other users and contributors.

Events don't have to be organized by the Knative project to be added to the calendar.
If you want to add an event to the calendar please send an email to
[knative-steering@googlegroups.com](mailto:knative-steering@googlegroups.com)
or post to the #community channel in the Knative [Slack](https://slack.knative.dev) workspace.

### Developers

Knative components offer developers Kubernetes-native APIs for deploying
serverless-style functions, applications, and containers to an auto-scaling
runtime.

To join the conversation, head over to the
[Knative users](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/knative-users) Google group.

### Operators

Knative components are intended to be integrated into more polished products
that cloud service providers or in-house teams in large enterprises can then
operate.

Any enterprise or cloud provider can adopt Knative components into their own
systems and pass the benefits along to their customers.

### Contributors

With a clear project scope, lightweight governance model, and clean lines of
separation between pluggable components, the Knative project establishes an
efficient contributor workflow.

Knative is a diverse, open, and inclusive community.
Your own path to becoming a Knative contributor can begin in any of the
following components:
