# Community Rules and Practices

This page provides links to documents for common Knative community practices and
a description of Knative's audience.

While the project was started by Google, it has received contributions from [over 200 companies](https://knative.devstats.cncf.io/d/21/prs-authors-companies-table) and is now governed by the [CNCF](https://cncf.io/).
