### Triggers

After an event has entered a broker, it can be forwarded to subscribers by using Triggers. Triggers allow events to be filtered by attributes, so that events with particular attributes can be sent to Subscribers that have registered interest in events with those attributes.

### Subscribers

A Subscriber can be any URL or Addressable resource. Subscribers can also reply to an active request from the Broker, and can respond with a new event that is sent back into the Broker.
