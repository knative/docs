This page contains information about various tools and technologies that are
useful to anyone developing on Knative.

## Community Resources

This section contains tools and technologies developed by members of the Knative
community specifically for use with Knative.

### [`knctl`](https://github.com/cppforlife/knctl)

`knctl` is an under-development CLI for working with Knative.

## Other Resources

This section contains other tools and technologies that are useful when working
with Knative.

### [`go-containerregistry`](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/)

`go-containerregistry` is a Go library used by `ko`, `kaniko`, `skaffold` and
others, which enables support for pushing, pulling and managing images in a
container image registry, without requiring Docker to be installed.

It also provides packages to interact with images in a local Docker daemon,
which does require that Docker be installed.

This library also provides a CLI tool called
[`crane`](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/blob/master/cmd/crane/doc/crane.md),
which can be used to interact with and inspect images in a registry.

### [`jib`](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib)

`jib` is a tool, packaged as a Maven plugin and a Gradle plugin, that
efficiently builds container images from Java source, without a Dockerfile,
without requiring access to the Docker daemon.

Like `ko`, when `jib` is invoked, it builds your Java source and pushes an image
with that built source atop a
[distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless) base image to
produce small images that support fast incremental image builds.

There are `BuildTemplate`s that wraps `jib` for use with Maven and Gradle, at
https://github.com/knative/build-templates/blob/master/jib/. It expects that
your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` describes to `jib` where to push your image.
The build templates take no parameters.

### [`kaniko`](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko)

`kaniko` is a tool that enables building a container image from source using the
Dockerfile format, without requiring access to a Docker daemon. Removing this
requirement means that `kaniko` is
[safe to run on a Kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/1806).

By contrast, building an image using `docker build` necessarily requires the
Docker daemon, which would give the build complete access to your entire
cluster. So that's a very bad idea.

`kaniko` expects to run inside a container, so it's a natural fit for the Build
CRD [builder contract](...). `kaniko` is available as a builder at
`gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:latest`, and there's a `BuildTemplate` that
wraps it at
https://github.com/knative/build-templates/blob/master/kaniko/kaniko.yaml. It
exposes one required parameter, `IMAGE`, which describes the name of the image
to push to.

More information here:
https://github.com/knative/build-templates/tree/master/kaniko

`kaniko` is unrelated to `ko`.

### [`ko`](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/tree/master/cmd/ko)

`ko` is a tool designed to make development of Go apps on Kubernetes easier, by
abstracting away the container image being used, and instead referring to Go
packages by their [import paths](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#ImportPaths)
(e.g., `github.com/kaniko/serving/cmd/controller`)

The typical usage is `ko apply --filename config.yaml`, which reads in the config YAML,
and looks for Go import paths representing runnable commands (i.e.,
`package main`). When it finds a matching import path, `ko` builds the package
using `go build` then pushes a container image containing that binary on top of
a base image (by default, `gcr.io/distroless/base`) to
`$KO_DOCKER_REPO/unique-string`. After pushing those images, `ko` replaces
instances of matched import paths with fully-qualified references to the images
it pushed.

So if `ko apply` was passed this config:

```yaml
---
image: github.com/my/repo/cmd/foo
```

...it would produce YAML like:

```yaml
---
image: gcr.io/my-docker-repo/foo-zyxwvut@sha256:abcdef # image by digest
```

(This assumes that you have set the environment variable
`KO_DOCKER_REPO=gcr.io/my-docker-repo`)

`ko apply` then passes this generated YAML config to `kubectl apply`.

`ko` also supports:

- `ko publish` to simply push images and not produce configs.
- `ko resolve` to push images and output the generated configs, but not
  `kubectl apply` them.
- `ko delete` to simply passthrough to `kubectl delete` for convenience.

`ko` is used during development and release of Knative components, but is not
intended to be required for _users_ of Knative -- they should only need to
`kubectl apply` released configs generated by `ko`.

### [`skaffold`](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold)

`skaffold` is a CLI tool to aid in iterative development for Kubernetes.
Typically, you would write a
[YAML config](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold/blob/master/examples/annotated-skaffold.yaml)
describing to Skaffold how to build and deploy your app, then run
`skaffold dev`, which will watch your local source tree for changes and
continuously builds and deploys based on your config when changes are detected.

Skaffold supports many pluggable implementations for building and deploying.
Skaffold contributors are working on support for Knative Build as a build
plugin, and could support Knative Serving as a deployment plugin.
