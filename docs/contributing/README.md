# About Knative

Knative is an open source project with an active development community.
The project was started by Google but has contributions from a growing number of industry-leading companies. With a clear project scope, lightweight governance model, and clean lines of
separation between pluggable components, the Knative project establishes an
efficient contributor workflow.

Knative is a diverse, open, and inclusive community.

Knative is designed for different personas:

Knative components offer developers Kubernetes-native APIs for deploying
serverless-style functions, applications, and containers to an auto-scaling
runtime.

To join the conversation, head over to the
[Knative users](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/knative-users) Google group.

Knative components are intended to be integrated into more polished products
that cloud service providers or in-house teams in large enterprises can then
operate.

Any enterprise or cloud provider can adopt Knative components into their own
systems and pass the benefits along to their customers.

## Community Meetup

This virtual event is designed for end users, a space for our community to meet,
get to know each other, and learn about uses and applications of Knative.

Catch up with past community meetups on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQjzPfIiEQLLyCyLBKLlwDLfE_A-P7nyg).

Stay tuned for new events by subscribing to the
[calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=knative.team_9q83bg07qs5b9rrslp5jor4l6s%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles) ([iCal export file](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/knative.team_9q83bg07qs5b9rrslp5jor4l6s%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics))
and following us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KnativeProject).

## More ways to get involved

Even if there’s not an issue opened for it, we can always use more testing throughout the platform. Similarly, we can always use more docs, richer docs, insightful docs. Or maybe a cool blog post? And if you’re a web developer, we could use your help in spiffing up our public-facing web site.

[Bug reports](https://github.com/knative/serving/issues/new) and friction logs
from new developers are especially welcome.
