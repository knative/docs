# Creating an ApiServerSource object

![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/API_Version-v1-red?style=flat-square)

This topic describes how to create an ApiServerSource object.

## Before you begin

Before you can create an ApiServerSource object:

- You must have [Knative Eventing](../../../../../admin/install/eventing/install-eventing-with-yaml)
installed on your cluster.
- You must install the [`kubectl` CLI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
tool.
- Optional: If you want to use the `kn` commands, install the [`kn`](../../../../../client/install-kn/) tool.

## Create an ApiServerSource object

1. Optional: Create a namespace for the API server source instance by running the
command:

    ```bash
    kubectl create namespace <namespace>
    ```
    Where `<namespace>` is the name of the namespace that you want to create.

    !!! note
        Creating a namespace for your ApiServerSource and related components
        allows you to view changes and events for this workflow more easily, since
        these are isolated from the many other components that may exist in your `default` namespace.<br><br>
        It also makes removing the source easier, since you can simply delete the namespace to remove all of the resources.

1. Create a ServiceAccount:

    1. Create a YAML file using the template below:

        ```yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: ServiceAccount
        metadata:
          name: <service-account>
          namespace: <namespace>
        ```
        Where:

        - `<service-account>` is the name of the ServiceAccount that you want to create.
        - `<namespace>` is the namespace that you created in step 1 above.

    1. Apply the YAML file by running the command:

        ```bash
        kubectl apply --filename <filename>.yaml
        ```
        Where `<filename>` is the name of the file you created in the previous step.

1. Create a ClusterRole:

    1. Create a YAML file using the template below:

        ```yaml
        apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
        kind: ClusterRole
        metadata:
          name: <cluster-role>
        rules:
        - apiGroups:
          - ""
          resources:
          - events
          verbs:
          - get
          - list
          - watch
        ```
        Where `<cluster-role>` is the name of the ClusterRole that you want to create.

    1. Apply the YAML file by running the command:

        ```bash
        kubectl apply --filename <filename>.yaml
        ```
        Where `<filename>` is the name of the file you created in the previous step.

1. Create a ClusterRoleBinding:

    1. Create a YAML file using the template below:

        ```yaml
        apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
        kind: ClusterRoleBinding
        metadata:
          name: <cluster-role-binding>
        roleRef:
          apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
          kind: ClusterRole
          name: <cluster-role>
        subjects:
        - kind: ServiceAccount
          name: <service-account>
          namespace: <namespace>
        ```
        Where:

        - `<cluster-role-binding>` is the name of the ClusterRoleBinding that you want to create.
        - `<cluster-role>` is the name of the ClusterRole that you created in step 3 above.
        - `<service-account>` is the name of the ServiceAccount that you created in step 2 above.
        - `<namespace>` is the name of the namespace that you created in step 1 above.

    1. Apply the YAML file by running the command:

        ```bash
        kubectl apply --filename <filename>.yaml
        ```
        Where `<filename>` is the name of the file you created in the previous step.

1. Create the ApiServerSource object:

    === "kn"
        - To create the ApiServerSource, run the command:

            ```bash
            kn source apiserver create <apiserversource> \
              --namespace <namespace> \
              --mode "Resource" \
              --resource "Event:v1" \
              --service-account <service-account> \
              --sink <sink>
            ```
            Where:

            - `<apiserversource>` is the name of the source that you want to create.
            - `<namespace>` is the name of the namespace that you created in step 1 above.
            - `<service-account>` is the name of the ServiceAccount that you created in step 2 above.
            - `<sink>` is the name of the PodSpecable object that you want to use as a sink.
            A PodSpecable is an object that describes a PodSpec.

    === "YAML"
        1. Create a YAML file using the template below:

            ```yaml
            apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1
            kind: ApiServerSource
            metadata:
             name: <apiserversource>
             namespace: <namespace>
            spec:
             serviceAccountName: <service-account>
             mode: <event-mode>
             resources:
               - apiVersion: v1
                 kind: Event
             sink:
               ref:
                 apiVersion: v1
                 kind: <sink-kind>
                 name: <sink-name>
            ```
            Where:

            - `<apiserversource>` is the name of the source that you want to create.
            - `<namespace>` is the name of the namespace that you created in step 1 above.
            - `<service-account>` is the name of the ServiceAccount that you created in step 2 above.
            - `<event-mode>` is either `Resource` or `Reference`. If set to `Resource`, the event payload contains the entire resource that the event is for. If set to `Reference`, the event payload only contains a reference to the resource that the event is for. The default is `Reference`.
            - `<sink-kind>` is any supported PodSpecable object that you want to use as a sink, for example, `Service` or `Deployment`. A PodSpecable is an object that describes a PodSpec.
            - `<sink-name>` is the name of your sink.

        1. Apply the YAML file by running the command:

            ```bash
            kubectl apply --filename <filename>.yaml
            ```
            Where `<filename>` is the name of the file you created in the previous step.

## Verify the ApiServerSource object

1. Make the Kubernetes API server create events by launching a test pod in your namespace by running the command:

    ```bash
    kubectl run busybox --image=busybox --namespace=<namespace> --restart=Never -- ls
    ```
    Where `<namespace>` is the name of the namespace that you created in step 1 above.

1. Delete the test pod by running the command:

    ```bash
    kubectl --namespace=<namespace> delete pod busybox
    ```
    Where `<namespace>` is the name of the namespace that you created in step 1 above.

1. View the logs to verify that Kubernetes events were sent to the sink by the Knative Eventing system by running the command:

    ```bash
    kubectl logs --namespace=<namespace> -l app=<sink> --tail=100
    ```
    Where:

    - `<namespace>` is the name of the namespace that you created in step 1 above.
    - `<sink>` is the name of the PodSpecable object that you used as a sink in step 5 above.

    Example log output:

        },
        "type": "Normal"
      }
    ```

## Delete the ApiServerSource

To remove the ApiServerSource object and all of the related resources:

- Delete the namespace by running the command:

    ```bash
    kubectl delete namespace <namespace>
    ```
    Where `<namespace>` is the name of the namespace that you created in step 1 above.
