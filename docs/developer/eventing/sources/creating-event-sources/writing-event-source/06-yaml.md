# Publishing to your Kubernetes cluster

## Run the sample source locally

Start a minikube cluster.

_If you already have a Kubernetes cluster running, you can skip this step. The
cluster must be 1.15+_

```sh
minikube start
```

Setup `ko` to use the minikube docker instance and local registry
```sh
eval $(minikube docker-env)
export KO_DOCKER_REPO=ko.local
```

Apply the CRD and configuration yaml
```sh
ko apply -f config
```

Once the `sample-source-controller-manager` is running in the `knative-samples` namespace, you can
apply the `example.yaml` to connect our `sample-source` every `10s` directly to a `ksvc`.

```yaml
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: event-display
  namespace: knative-samples
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: gcr.io/knative-releases/knative.dev/eventing/cmd/event_display
---
apiVersion: samples.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: SampleSource
metadata:
  name: sample-source
  namespace: knative-samples
spec:
  interval: "10s"
  sink:
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: event-display
```
```sh
ko apply -f example.yaml
```

Once reconciled, you can confirm the `ksvc` is outputting valid cloudevents every `10s` to align with our specified interval.

```sh
% kubectl -n knative-samples logs -l serving.knative.dev/service=event-display -c user-container -f
```
```
