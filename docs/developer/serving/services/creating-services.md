# Creating a Service

You can create a Knative service by applying a YAML file or using the `kn service create` CLI command.

## Prerequisites

To create a Knative service, you will need:

* A Kubernetes cluster with [Knative Serving installed](../../../../admin/install).
* Optional: To use the `kn service create` command, you must [install the `kn` CLI](../../../../client/install-kn).

## Procedure

!!! tip

    The following commands create a `helloworld-go` sample service. You can modify these commands, including the container image URL, to deploy your own application as a Knative service.

Create a sample service:

=== "Apply YAML"

1. Create a YAML file using the example below:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
     name: helloworld-go
     namespace: default
    spec:
     template:
      spec:
       containers:
        - image: gcr.io/knative-samples/helloworld-go
          env:
            - name: TARGET
              value: "Go Sample v1"
    ```
1. Apply the YAML file by running the command:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply --filename <filename>.yaml
    ```
    Where `<filename>` is the name of the file you created in the previous step.
    
=== "kn CLI"

    ```
    kn service create helloworld-go --image gcr.io/knative-samples/helloworld-go
    ```

After the service has been created, Knative performs the following tasks:

* Creates a new immutable revision for this version of the app.
* Performs network programming to create a route, ingress, service, and load balancer for your app.
* Automatically scales your pods up and down based on traffic, including to zero active pods.
