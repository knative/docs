Before you can use the multi-tenant (MT) channel-based broker implementation, you must install a [channel provider](../../channels/channel-types-defaults).
<!--TODO: explain how channels are used for routing-->

**NOTE:** InMemoryChannel channels are for development use only and must not be used in a production deployment.
