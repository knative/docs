# Triggers

A trigger represents a desire to subscribe to events from a specific broker.

The `subscriber` value must be a [Destination](https://pkg.go.dev/knative.dev/pkg/apis/duck/v1#Destination).

## Example Triggers

The following trigger receives all the events from the `default` broker and
delivers them to the Knative Serving service `my-service`:

1. Create a YAML file using the example below:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
    kind: Trigger
    metadata:
      name: my-service-trigger
    spec:
      broker: default
      subscriber:
        ref:
          apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
          kind: Service
          name: my-service
    ```

1. Apply the YAML file by running the command:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply --filename <filename>.yaml
    ```
    Where `<filename>` is the name of the file you created in the previous step.


The following trigger receives all the events from the `default` broker and
delivers them to the custom path `/my-custom-path` for the Kubernetes service `my-service`:

1. Create a YAML file using the example below:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
    kind: Trigger
    metadata:
      name: my-service-trigger
    spec:
      broker: default
      subscriber:
        ref:
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: Service
          name: my-service
        uri: /my-custom-path
    ```

1. Apply the YAML file by running the command:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply --filename <filename>.yaml
    ```
    Where `<filename>` is the name of the file you created in the previous step.

## Trigger filtering

Exact match filtering on any number of CloudEvents attributes as well as
extensions are supported. If your filter sets multiple attributes, an event must
have all of the attributes for the trigger to filter it. Note that we only
support exact matching on string values.

### Example

This example filters events from the `default` broker that are of type
`dev.knative.foo.bar` and have the extension `myextension` with the value
`my-extension-value`.

1. Create a YAML file using the example below:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
    kind: Trigger
    metadata:
      name: my-service-trigger
    spec:
      broker: default
      filter:
        attributes:
          type: dev.knative.foo.bar
          myextension: my-extension-value
      subscriber:
        ref:
          apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
          kind: Service
          name: my-service
    ```

1. Apply the YAML file by running the command:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply --filename <filename>.yaml
    ```
    Where `<filename>` is the name of the file you created in the previous step.
