Channels are Kubernetes Custom Resources which define a single event forwarding and persistence layer.
Messaging implementations may provide implementations of Channels via the
[ClusterChannelProvisioner](https://github.com/knative/eventing/blob/master/pkg/apis/eventing/v1alpha1/cluster_channel_provisioner_types.go#L35)
object, supporting different technologies, such as Apache Kafka or NATS Streaming.

This is a non-exhaustive list of Channels for Knative.


### Inclusion in this list is not an endorsement, nor does it imply any level of support.


## Channels

These are the channels `CRD`s.
