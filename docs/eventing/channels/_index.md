Channels are Kubernetes [custom resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) that define a single event forwarding and persistence layer.

A channel provides an event delivery mechanism that can fan-out received events, through subscriptions, to multiple destinations, or sinks. Examples of sinks include brokers and Knative services.
