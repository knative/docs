# Channel types and defaults
Knative uses two types of channels:
* The generic Channel object
* Channel implementations that each have their own custom resource definitions (CRDs), such as
`InMemoryChannel` and `KafkaChannel`.

The custom Channel implementations each have their own event delivery mechanisms, such as in-memory
or broker-based. Example brokers include Kafka and GCP Pub/Sub.

Knative provides the `InMemoryChannel` channel implementation by default.
This default implementation is useful for developers who do not want to configure a specific
implementation type, such as Apache Kafka or NATSS channels.

Through the generic Channel object you can create a channel without specifying which channel
implementation CRD is used.
This is useful if you do not care about the properties a particular channel provides, such as
ordering and persistence, and you want to use the implementation selected by the operator.
The operator controls the default settings through the `default-ch-webhook` ConfigMap in the
`knative-eventing` namespace.

For more information about modifying ConfigMaps, see
[Configuring the Eventing Operator custom resource](./docs/install/configuring-eventing-cr/).

Default channels can be configured for the cluster, a namespace on the cluster, or both.

**NOTE:** If a default channel implementation is configured for a namespace, this will overwrite the
configuration for the cluster.

In the following example, the cluster default channel implementation is `InMemoryChannel`, while the
namespace default channel implementation for the `example-namespace` is `KafkaChannel`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: default-ch-webhook
  namespace: knative-eventing
data:
  default-ch-config: |
    clusterDefault:
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      kind: InMemoryChannel
    namespaceDefaults:
      example-namespace:
        apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1beta1
        kind: KafkaChannel
        spec:
          numPartitions: 2
          replicationFactor: 1
```

**NOTE:** `InMemoryChannel` channels should not be used in production environments.
