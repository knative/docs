Name | Status | Support | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
[GCP PubSub](https://github.com/google/knative-gcp) | Proof of Concept | None | Channels are backed by [GCP PubSub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/).
[InMemoryChannel](https://github.com/knative/eventing/tree/{{ branch }}/config/channels/in-memory-channel/README.md) | Proof of Concept | None | In-memory channels are a best effort Channel. They should NOT be used in Production. They are useful for development.

The original Knative KafkaChannel implementation which utilizes a single combined Kafka Producer / Consumer deployment.

An alternate KafkaChannel implementation, contributed by SAP's [Kyma](https://kyma-project.io/) project, which provides a more granular deployment of Producers / Consumers.
