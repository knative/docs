Choice CRD provides a way to easily define a list of branches that will be
invoked. Each branch consists of a filter function guarding the execution of the
branch. When the filter passes, the rest of the branch is executed.

Choice creates `Channel`s and `Subscription`s under the hood.

## Usage

### Choice Spec

Choice has three parts for the Spec:

1. `cases` defines the list of `filter` and `subscriber` pairs, one per
    branch, and optionally a `reply` object. For each branch:
    1. the `filter` is evaluated and when it returns an event the `subscriber` is executed.
    Both `filter` and `subscriber` must be `Callable`.
    1. the event returned by the `subscriber` is sent to the branch `reply` object. When
    the `reply` is empty, the event is sent to the `spec.reply` object (see below).
1. (optional) `channelTemplate` defines the Template which will be used to create
   `Channel`s.
1. (optional) `reply` defines where the result of each branch is sent to when the branch does
   not have its own `reply` object.

### Choice Status

Choice has three parts for the Status:

1. Conditions which detail the overall Status of the Choice object
1. IngressChannelStatus and CaseStatuses which convey the Status
   of underlying `Channel` and `Subscription` resource  that are created as part of this Choice.
1. AddressStatus which is exposed so that Choice can be used where Addressable
   can be used. Sending to this address will target the `Channel` which is
   fronting this Choice (same as `IngressChannelStatus`).
