# Debugging Knative Eventing

This is an evolving document on how to debug a non-working Knative Eventing
setup.

## Audience

This document is intended for people that are familiar with the object model of
[Knative Eventing](../README.md). You don't need to be an expert, but do need to
know roughly how things fit together.

## Prerequisites

1. Setup [Knative Eventing and an Eventing-contrib resource](../README.md).

## Example

This guide uses an example consisting of an event source that sends events to a
function.

![src -> chan -> sub -> svc -> fn](ExampleModel.png)

See [example.yaml](example.yaml) for the entire YAML. For any commands in this
guide to work, you must apply [example.yaml](example.yaml):

```shell
kubectl apply --filename example.yaml
```

## Triggering Events

Knative events will occur whenever a Kubernetes
[`Event`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.18/#event-v1-core)
occurs in the `knative-debug` namespace. We can cause this to occur with the
following commands:

```shell
kubectl --namespace knative-debug run to-be-deleted --image=image-that-doesnt-exist --restart=Never
# 5 seconds is arbitrary. We want K8s to notice that the Pod needs to be scheduled and generate at least one event.
sleep 5
kubectl --namespace knative-debug delete pod to-be-deleted
```

Then we can see the Kubernetes `Event`s (note that these are not Knative
events!):

```shell
kubectl --namespace knative-debug get events
```

This should produce output along the lines of:

```shell
LAST SEEN   FIRST SEEN   COUNT     NAME                             KIND      SUBOBJECT                        TYPE      REASON                   SOURCE                                         MESSAGE
20s         20s          1         to-be-deleted.157aadb9f376fc4e   Pod                                        Normal    Scheduled                default-scheduler                              Successfully assigned knative-debug/to-be-deleted to gke-kn24-default-pool-c12ac83b-pjf2
```

## Where are my events?

You've applied [example.yaml](example.yaml) and you are inspecting `fn`'s logs:

```shell
kubectl --namespace knative-debug logs -l app=fn -c user-container
```

But you don't see any events arrive. Where is the problem?

### Control Plane

We will first check the control plane, to ensure everything should be working
properly.

#### Resources

The first thing to check are all the created resources, do their statuses
contain `ready` true?

We will attempt to determine why from the most basic pieces out:

1. `fn` - The `Deployment` has no dependencies inside Knative.
1. `svc` - The `Service` has no dependencies inside Knative.
1. `chan` - The `Channel` depends on its backing `channel implementation` and
   somewhat depends on `sub`.
1. `src` - The `Source` depends on `chan`.
1. `sub` - The `Subscription` depends on both `chan` and `svc`.

##### `fn`

```shell
kubectl --namespace knative-debug get deployment fn -o jsonpath='{.status.availableReplicas}'
```

We want to see `1`. If you don't, then you need to debug the `Deployment`. Is
there anything obviously wrong mentioned in the `status`?

```shell
kubectl --namespace knative-debug get deployment fn --output yaml
```

If it is not obvious what is wrong, then you need to debug the `Deployment`,
which is out of scope of this document.

Verify that the `Pod` is `Ready`:

```shell
kubectl --namespace knative-debug get pod -l app=fn -o jsonpath='{.items[*].status.conditions[?(@.type == "Ready")].status}'
```

This should return `True`. If it doesn't, then try to debug the `Deployment`
using the
[Kubernetes Application Debugging](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/debug-application-introspection/)
guide.

##### `svc`

```shell
kubectl --namespace knative-debug get service svc
```

We just want to ensure this exists and has the correct name. If it doesn't
exist, then you probably need to re-apply [example.yaml](example.yaml).

Verify it points at the expected pod.

```shell
{% raw %}
svcLabels=$(kubectl --namespace knative-debug get service svc -o go-template='{{range $k, $v := .spec.selector}}{{ $k }}={{ $v }},{{ end }}' | sed 's/.$//' )
kubectl --namespace knative-debug get pods -l $svcLabels
{% endraw %}
```

This should return a single Pod, which if you inspect is the one generated by
`fn`.

##### `chan`

`chan` uses the
[`in-memory-channel`]( https://github.com/knative/eventing/tree/{{ branch }}/config/channels/in-memory-channel).
This is a very basic channel and has few
failure modes that will be exhibited in `chan`'s `status`.

```shell
kubectl --namespace knative-debug get channel.messaging.knative.dev chan -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type == "Ready")].status}'
```

This should return `True`. If it doesn't, get the full resource:

```shell
kubectl --namespace knative-debug get channel.messaging.knative.dev chan --output yaml
```

If `status` is completely missing, it implies that something is wrong with the
`in-memory-channel` controller. See [Channel Controller](#channel-controller).

Next verify that `chan` is addressable:

```shell
kubectl --namespace knative-debug get channel.messaging.knative.dev chan -o jsonpath='{.status.address.hostname}'
```

This should return a URI, likely ending in '.cluster.local'. If it doesn't, then
it implies that something went wrong during reconciliation. See
[Channel Controller](#channel-controller).

We will verify that the two resources that the `chan` creates exist and are
`Ready`.

###### `Service`

`chan` creates a K8s `Service`.

```shell
kubectl --namespace knative-debug get service -l messaging.knative.dev/role=in-memory-channel
```

It's spec is completely unimportant, as Istio will ignore it. It just needs to
exist so that `src` can send events to it. If it doesn't exist, it implies that
something went wrong during `chan` reconciliation. See
[Channel Controller](#channel-controller).

##### `src`

`src` is a [`ApiServerSource`](../sources/apiserversource.md).

First we will verify that `src` is writing to `chan`.

```shell
kubectl --namespace knative-debug get apiserversource src -o jsonpath='{.spec.sink}'
```

Which should return
`map[apiVersion:messaging.knative.dev/v1 kind:Channel name:chan]`. If it
doesn't, then `src` was setup incorrectly and its `spec` needs to be fixed.
Fixing should be as simple as updating its `spec` to have the correct `sink`
(see [example.yaml](example.yaml)).

Now that we know `src` is sending to `chan`, let's verify that it is `Ready`.

```shell
kubectl --namespace knative-debug get apiserversource src -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(.type == "Ready")].status}'
```

#### `sub`

`sub` is a `Subscription` from `chan` to `fn`.

Verify that `sub` is `Ready`:

```shell
kubectl --namespace knative-debug get subscription sub -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(.type == "Ready")].status}'
```

This should return `True`. If it doesn't then, look at all the status entries.

```shell
kubectl --namespace knative-debug get subscription sub --output yaml
```

#### Controllers

Each of the resources has a Controller that is watching it. As of today, they
tend to do a poor job of writing failure status messages and events, so we need
to look at the Controller's logs.

##### Deployment Controller

The Kubernetes Deployment Controller, controlling `fn`, is out of scope for this
document.

##### Service Controller

The Kubernetes Service Controller, controlling `svc`, is out of scope for this
document.

##### Channel Controller

There is not a single `Channel` Controller. Instead, there is one
Controller for each Channel CRD. `chan` uses the
`InMemoryChannel` `Channel CRD`, whose Controller is:

```shell
kubectl --namespace knative-eventing get pod -l messaging.knative.dev/channel=in-memory-channel,messaging.knative.dev/role=controller --output yaml
```

See its logs with:

```shell
kubectl --namespace knative-eventing logs -l messaging.knative.dev/channel=in-memory-channel,messaging.knative.dev/role=controller
```

Pay particular attention to any lines that have a logging level of `warning` or
`error`.

##### Source Controller

Each Source will have its own Controller. `src` is a `ApiServerSource`, so
its Controller is:

```shell
kubectl --namespace knative-eventing get pod -l app=sources-controller
```

This is actually a single binary that runs multiple Source Controllers,
importantly including [ApiServerSource Controller](#apiserversource-controller).

###### ApiServerSource Controller

The `ApiServerSource` Controller is run in the same binary as some other Source
Controllers from Eventing. It is:

```shell
kubectl --namespace knative-debug get pod -l eventing.knative.dev/sourceName=src,eventing.knative.dev/source=apiserver-source-controller
```

View its logs with:

```shell
kubectl --namespace knative-debug logs -l eventing.knative.dev/sourceName=src,eventing.knative.dev/source=apiserver-source-controller
```

Pay particular attention to any lines that have a logging level of `warning` or
`error`.

##### Subscription Controller

The `Subscription` Controller controls `sub`. It attempts to resolve the
addresses that a `Channel` should send events to, and once resolved, inject
those into the `Channel`'s `spec.subscribable`.

```shell
kubectl --namespace knative-eventing get pod -l app=eventing-controller
```

View its logs with:

```shell
kubectl --namespace knative-eventing logs -l app=eventing-controller
```

Pay particular attention to any lines that have a logging level of `warning` or
`error`.

### Data Plane

The entire [Control Plane](#control-plane) looks healthy, but we're still not
getting any events. Now we need to investigate the data plane.

The Knative event takes the following path:

1. Event is generated by `src`.

   - In this case, it is caused by having a Kubernetes `Event` trigger it, but
     as far as Knative is concerned, the `Source` is generating the event denovo
     (from nothing).

1. `src` is POSTing the event to `chan`'s address,
   `http://chan-kn-channel.knative-debug.svc.cluster.local`.

1. The Channel Dispatcher receives the request and introspects the Host header
   to determine which `Channel` it corresponds to. It sees that it corresponds
   to `knative-debug/chan` so forwards the request to the subscribers defined in
   `sub`, in particular `svc`, which is backed by `fn`.

1. `fn` receives the request and logs it.

We will investigate components in the order in which events should travel.

#### Channel Dispatcher

The Channel Dispatcher is the component that receives POSTs pushing events into
`Channel`s and then POSTs to subscribers of those `Channel`s when an event is
received. For the `in-memory-channel` used in this example, there is a single
binary that handles both the receiving and dispatching sides for all
`in-memory-channel` `Channel`s.

First we will inspect the Dispatcher's logs to see if it is anything obvious:

```shell
kubectl --namespace knative-eventing logs -l messaging.knative.dev/channel=in-memory-channel,messaging.knative.dev/role=dispatcher -c dispatcher
```

Ideally we will see lines like:

```shell
{"level":"info","ts":"2019-08-16T13:50:55.424Z","logger":"inmemorychannel-dispatcher.in-memory-channel-dispatcher","caller":"provisioners/message_receiver.go:147","msg":"Request mapped to channel: knative-debug/chan-kn-channel","knative.dev/controller":"in-memory-channel-dispatcher"}
{"level":"info","ts":"2019-08-16T13:50:55.425Z","logger":"inmemorychannel-dispatcher.in-memory-channel-dispatcher","caller":"provisioners/message_dispatcher.go:112","msg":"Dispatching message to http://svc.knative-debug.svc.cluster.local/","knative.dev/controller":"in-memory-channel-dispatcher"}
{"level":"info","ts":"2019-08-16T13:50:55.981Z","logger":"inmemorychannel-dispatcher.in-memory-channel-dispatcher","caller":"provisioners/message_receiver.go:140","msg":"Received request for chan-kn-channel.knative-debug.svc.cluster.local","knative.dev/controller":"in-memory-channel-dispatcher"}
```

Which shows that the request is being received and then sent to `svc`, which is
returning a 2XX response code (likely 200, 202, or 204).

However if we see something like:

<!--
 NOTE: This error has been produced by settings spec.ports[0].port to 8081
 kubectl patch -n knative-debug svc svc -p '{"spec":{"ports": [{"port": 8081, "targetPort":8080}]}}' --type='merge'
-->
```shell
{"level":"info","ts":"2019-08-16T16:10:16.859Z","logger":"inmemorychannel-dispatcher.in-memory-channel-dispatcher","caller":"provisioners/message_receiver.go:140","msg":"Received request for chan-kn-channel.knative-debug.svc.cluster.local","knative.dev/controller":"in-memory-channel-dispatcher"}
{"level":"info","ts":"2019-08-16T16:10:16.859Z","logger":"inmemorychannel-dispatcher.in-memory-channel-dispatcher","caller":"provisioners/message_receiver.go:147","msg":"Request mapped to channel: knative-debug/chan-kn-channel","knative.dev/controller":"in-memory-channel-dispatcher"}
{"level":"info","ts":"2019-08-16T16:10:16.859Z","logger":"inmemorychannel-dispatcher.in-memory-channel-dispatcher","caller":"provisioners/message_dispatcher.go:112","msg":"Dispatching message to http://svc.knative-debug.svc.cluster.local/","knative.dev/controller":"in-memory-channel-dispatcher"}
{"level":"error","ts":"2019-08-16T16:10:38.169Z","logger":"inmemorychannel-dispatcher.in-memory-channel-dispatcher","caller":"fanout/fanout_handler.go:121","msg":"Fanout had an error","knative.dev/controller":"in-memory-channel-dispatcher","error":"Unable to complete request Post http://svc.knative-debug.svc.cluster.local/: dial tcp 10.4.44.156:80: i/o timeout","stacktrace":"knative.dev/eventing/pkg/provisioners/fanout.(*Handler).dispatch\n\t/Users/xxxxxx/go/src/knative.dev/eventing/pkg/provisioners/fanout/fanout_handler.go:121\nknative.dev/eventing/pkg/provisioners/fanout.createReceiverFunction.func1.1\n\t/Users/i512777/go/src/knative.dev/eventing/pkg/provisioners/fanout/fanout_handler.go:95"}
```

Then we know there was a problem posting to
`http://svc.knative-debug.svc.cluster.local/`.

TODO Finish this section. Especially after the Channel Dispatcher emits K8s
events about failures.

#### `fn`

TODO Fill in this section.

# TODO Finish the guide.
