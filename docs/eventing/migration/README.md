Knative Eventing in version 0.13 does deprecate a few resources and
introduces new constructs for fine-grained control
over underlying resources.
This document provides a collection of such examples:
* [PingSource](./ping.md) migration from `CronJobSource`.
* [SinkBinding](./sinkbinding.md) alternative to `ContainerSource`.
