These samples show how to configure a Camel source. It is a event source that
can leverage one of the
[250+ Apache Camel components](https://github.com/apache/camel/tree/master/components)
for generating events.

## Prerequisites

1. [Install Knative Serving and Eventing](../../../install).

1. Install the [Apache Camel K](https://github.com/apache/camel-k) Operator in
   any namespace where you want to run Camel sources.

   The preferred version that is compatible with Camel sources is
   [Camel K v0.2.0](https://github.com/apache/camel-k/releases/tag/0.2.0).

   Installation instruction are provided on the
   [Apache Camel K Github repository](https://github.com/apache/camel-k#installation).
   Documentation includes specific instructions for common Kubernetes
   environments, including development clusters.

1. Install the Camel Source from the `camel.yaml` in the
   [Eventing Sources release page](https://github.com/knative/eventing-contrib/releases):

   ```shell
   kubectl apply --filename camel.yaml
   ```

## Create a Channel and a Subscriber

In order to check if a `CamelSource` is fully working, we will create:

- a simple Knative event display service that prints incoming events to its log
- a in-memory channel named `camel-test` that will buffer events created by the
  event source
- a subscription to direct events from the test channel to the event display
  service

Deploy the [`display_resources.yaml`](./display_resources.yaml):

```shell
kubectl apply --filename display_resources.yaml
```

## Run a CamelSource using the Timer component

The simplest example of CamelSource, that does not require additional
configuration, is the "timer" source.

If you want, you can customize the source behavior using options available in
the Apache Camel documentation for the
[timer component](https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/components/camel-timer/src/main/docs/timer-component.adoc).
All Camel components are documented in the
[Apache Camel github repository](https://github.com/apache/camel/tree/master/components).

Install the [`source_timer.yaml`](source_timer.yaml) resource:

```shell
kubectl apply --filename source_timer.yaml
```

We will verify that the published events were sent into the Knative eventing
system by looking at what is downstream of the `CamelSource`.

```shell
kubectl logs --selector serving.knative.dev/service=camel-event-display -c user-container
```

If you've deployed the timer source, you should see log lines appearing every 3
seconds.

## Run a CamelSource using the Telegram component

Another useful component available with Camel is the Telegram component. It can
be used to forward messages of a [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) chat into
Knative channels as events.

Before using the provided Telegram CamelSource example, you need to follow the
instructions on the Telegram website for creating a
[Telegram Bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots). The quickest way to create a bot
is to contact the [Bot Father](https://telegram.me/botfather), another Telegram
Bot, using your preferred Telegram client (mobile or web). After you create the
bot, you'll receive an **authorization token** that is needed for the source to
work.

First, download and edit the [`source_telegram.yaml`](source_telegram.yaml) file
and put the authorization token, replacing the `<put-your-token-here>`
placeholder.

To reduce noise in the event display, you can remove the previously created
timer CamelSource from the namespace:

```shell
kubectl delete camelsource camel-timer-source
```

Install the [`source_telegram.yaml`](source_telegram.yaml) resource:

```shell
kubectl apply -f source_telegram.yaml
```

Now, you can **send messages to your bot** with any Telegram client.

Check again the logs on the event display:

```shell
kubectl logs --selector serving.knative.dev/service=camel-event-display -c user-container
```

Each message you send to the bot will be printed by the event display as a
cloudevent.
