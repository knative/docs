This sample shows how to configure the GCP PubSub event source. This event
source is most useful as a bridge from other GCP services, such as
[Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/pubsub-notifications),
[IoT Core](https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/how-tos/devices) and
[Cloud Scheduler](https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/creating#).

## Prerequisites

1. Create a
   [Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects)
   and install the `gcloud` CLI and run `gcloud auth login`. This sample will
   use a mix of `gcloud` and `kubectl` commands. The rest of the sample assumes
   that you've set the `$PROJECT_ID` environment variable to your Google Cloud
   project id, and also set your project ID as default using
   `gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID`.

1. Setup [Knative Serving](../../../install)

1. Setup [Knative Eventing](../../../eventing). In addition, install the GCP
   PubSub event source from `release-gcppubsub.yaml`:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply --filename https://github.com/knative/eventing-contrib/releases/download/v0.7.0/gcppubsub.yaml
   ```

1. Enable the `Cloud Pub/Sub API` on your project:

   ```shell
   gcloud services enable pubsub.googleapis.com
   ```

1. Create a
   [GCP Service Account](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/project).
   This sample creates one service account for both registration and receiving
   messages, but you can also create a separate service account for receiving
   messages if you want additional privilege separation.

   1. Create a new service account named `knative-source` with the following
      command:
      ```shell
      gcloud iam service-accounts create knative-source
      ```
   1. Give that Service Account the `Pub/Sub Editor` role on your GCP project:
      ```shell
      gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
        --member=serviceAccount:knative-source@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
        --role roles/pubsub.editor
      ```
   1. Download a new JSON private key for that Service Account. **Be sure not to
      check this key into source control!**
      ```shell
      gcloud iam service-accounts keys create knative-source.json \
        --iam-account=knative-source@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
      ```
   1. Create two secrets on the kubernetes cluster with the downloaded key:

      ```shell
      # Note that the first secret may already have been created when installing
      # Knative Eventing. The following command will overwrite it. If you don't
      # want to overwrite it, then skip this command.
      kubectl --namespace knative-sources create secret generic gcppubsub-source-key --from-file=key.json=knative-source.json --dry-run --output yaml | kubectl apply --filename -

      # The second secret should not already exist, so just try to create it.
      kubectl --namespace default create secret generic google-cloud-key --from-file=key.json=knative-source.json
      ```

      `gcppubsub-source-key` and `key.json` are pre-configured values in the
      `controller-manager` StatefulSet which manages your Eventing sources.

      `google-cloud-key` and `key.json` are pre-configured values in
      [`gcp-pubsub-source.yaml`](./gcp-pubsub-source.yaml).

## Deployment

1. Create the `default` Broker in your namespace. These instructions assume the
   namespace `default`, feel free to change to any other namespace you would
   like to use instead:

   ```shell
   kubectl label namespace default knative-eventing-injection=enabled
   ```

1. Create a GCP PubSub Topic. If you change its name (`testing`), you also need
   to update the `topic` in the
   [`gcp-pubsub-source.yaml`](./gcp-pubsub-source.yaml) file:

   ```shell
   gcloud pubsub topics create testing
   ```

1. Replace the
   [`MY_GCP_PROJECT` placeholder](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects)
   in [`gcp-pubsub-source.yaml`](./gcp-pubsub-source.yaml) and apply it.

   If you're in the samples directory, you can replace `MY_GCP_PROJECT` and
   apply in one command:

   ```shell
   sed "s/MY_GCP_PROJECT/$PROJECT_ID/g" gcp-pubsub-source.yaml | \
       kubectl apply --filename -
   ```

   If you are replacing `MY_GCP_PROJECT` manually, then make sure you apply the
   resulting YAML:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply --filename gcp-pubsub-source.yaml
   ```

1. Create a function and create a Trigger that will send all events from the
   Broker to the function:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply --filename trigger.yaml
   ```

## Publish

Publish messages to your GCP PubSub Topic:

```shell
gcloud pubsub topics publish testing --message="Hello world"
```

## Verify

We will verify that the published message was sent into the Knative eventing
system by looking at the logs of the function subscribed to the `pubsub-test`
channel.

The function and the subscription were created by applying the
[`trigger.yaml`](./trigger.yaml) manifest in the [deployment](#deployment)
section above.

1. We need to wait for the downstream pods to get started and receive our event,
   wait 60 seconds.

   - You can check the status of the downstream pods with:

     ```shell
     kubectl get pods --selector serving.knative.dev/service=event-display
     ```

     You should see at least one.

1. Inspect the logs of the subscriber:

   ```shell
   kubectl logs --selector serving.knative.dev/service=event-display -c user-container
   ```

You should see log lines similar to:

```json
{
  "ID": "284375451531353",
  "Data": "SGVsbG8sIHdvcmxk",
  "Attributes": null,
  "PublishTime": "2018-10-31T00:00:00.00Z"
}
```

The log message is a dump of the message sent by `GCP PubSub`. In particular, if
you [base-64 decode](https://www.base64decode.org/) the `Data` field, you should
see the sent message:

```shell
echo "SGVsbG8sIHdvcmxk" | base64 --decode
```

Results in: "Hello world"

For more information about the format of the message, see the
[PubsubMessage documentation](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/reference/rest/v1/PubsubMessage).
