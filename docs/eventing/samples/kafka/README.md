The following examples will help you understand how to use the different Apache Kafka components for Knative.

## Prerequisites

All examples require:

- A Kubernetes cluster with
  - Knative Eventing v0.9+
  - Knative Serving v0.9+
- An Apache Kafka cluster

If you want to run the Apache Kafka cluster on Kubernetes, the simplest option is to install it by using Strimzi. Check out the [Quickstart](https://strimzi.io/quickstarts/) guides for both Minikube and Openshift. You can also install Kafka on the host.

## Examples
