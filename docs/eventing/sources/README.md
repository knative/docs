Event Sources are Kubernetes Custom Resources which provide a mechanism for
registering interest in a class of events from a particular software system.
Since different event sources may be described by different Custom Resources,
this page provides an index of the available source resource types as well as
links to installation instructions.

This is a non-exhaustive list of Event sources for Knative.

### Inclusion in this list is not an endorsement, nor does it imply any level of support.

## Sources

These are sources that are installed as `CRD`s.
