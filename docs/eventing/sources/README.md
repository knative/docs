An event source is a resource object that acts as a link between an event producer and an event _sink_. A sink can be a Knative Service, Channel, or Broker that receives events from an event source.

This page provides an index of the available source resource types as well as
links to their documentation.

## Knative Sources

| [Heartbeats](https://github.com/knative/eventing-contrib/tree/master/cmd/heartbeats) |  N/A | Knative    | Uses an in-memory timer to produce events at the specified interval. |
| [PingSource](./pingsource.md) | v1alpha2  | Knative    | Produces events with a fixed payload on a specified cron schedule. |
| [SinkBinding](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/samples/sinkbinding/)                                                               | v1alpha2           | Knative    | SinkBinding provides a framework for injecting `K_SINK` (destination address) and `K_CE_OVERRIDES` (JSON cloudevents attributes) environment variables into any Kubernetes resource which has a `spec.template` that looks like a Pod (aka PodSpecable). |
| [WebSocket](https://github.com/knative/eventing-contrib/tree/master/cmd/websocketsource)                                            | N/A | Knative    | Opens a WebSocket to the specified source and packages each received message as a Knative event.  |

Brings those events into Knative.
[FTP / SFTP](https://github.com/vaikas-google/ftp) | Proof of concept | None | Watches for files being uploaded into a FTP/SFTP and generates events for those.
[Heartbeat](https://github.com/Harwayne/auto-container-source/tree/master/heartbeat-source) | Proof of Concept | None | Uses an in-memory timer to produce events as the specified interval. Uses AutoContainerSource for underlying infrastructure.
[Konnek](https://konnek.github.io/docs/#/) | Active Development | None | Retrieves events from cloud platforms (like AWS and GCP) and transforms them into CloudEvents for consumption in Knative.
[K8s](https://github.com/Harwayne/auto-container-source/tree/master/k8s-event-source) | Proof of Concept | None | Brings Kubernetes cluster events into Knative. Uses AutoContainerSource for underlying infrastructure.
