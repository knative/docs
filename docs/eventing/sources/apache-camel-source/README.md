# Apache Camel source

Apache Camel based sources are now provided via [Kamelets](https://camel.apache.org/camel-kamelets/latest/) as part of the [Apache Camel K](https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/latest/installation/installation.html) project. Kamelets are a new technology that allow anyone to pick and use event sources and sinks from a [catalog](https://camel.apache.org/camel-kamelets/latest/), without having to dig into the internal details of Apache Camel.

The old Knative CamelSource controller has been archived.
