# Getting started

## Prerequisites

Before you can create an API server source, you must install Knative Eventing and the `kubectl` CLI tool.

## Create an API server source

1. Optional: Create a namespace for the API server source instance:

    ```shell
    kubectl create namespace <namespace>
    ```
    where;
    - `<namespace>` is the name of the namespace that you want to create.

    Creating a namespace for your API server source and related components allows you to view changes and events for this workflow more easily, since these are isolated from the many other components that may exist in your `default` namespace.

    It also makes removing the source easier, since you can simply delete the namespace to remove all of the resources.

1. Create a service account:

    ```yaml
    kubectl create -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ServiceAccount
    metadata:
      name: <service-account>
      namespace: <namespace>
    EOF
    ```
    where;
    - `<service-account>` is the name of the service account that you want to create.
    - `<namespace>` is the namespace that you created in step 1 above.

1. Create a cluster role:

    ```yaml
    kubectl create -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: ClusterRole
    metadata:
      name: <cluster-role>
    rules:
    - apiGroups:
      - ""
      resources:
      - events
      verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
    EOF
    ```
    where;
    - `<cluster-role>` is the name of the cluster role that you want to create.

1. Create a cluster role binding:

    ```yaml
    kubectl create -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: ClusterRoleBinding
    metadata:
      name: <cluster-role-binding>
    roleRef:
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: ClusterRole
      name: <cluster-role>
    subjects:
    - kind: ServiceAccount
      name: <service-account>
      namespace: <namespace>
    EOF
    ```
    where;
    - `<cluster-role-binding>` is the name of the cluster role binding that you want to create.
    - `<cluster-role>` is the name of the cluster role that you created in step 3 above.
    - `<service-account>` is the name of the service account that you created in step 2 above.
    - `<namespace>` is the name of the namespace that you created in step 1 above.

1. Create an ApiServerSource object:

    
=== "YAML"

    ```yaml
    kubectl create -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1
    kind: ApiServerSource
    metadata:
     name: <apiserversource>
     namespace: <namespace>
    spec:
     serviceAccountName: <service-account>
     mode: Resource
     resources:
       - apiVersion: v1
         kind: Event
     sink:
       ref:
         apiVersion: v1
         kind: Service
         name: <sink>
    EOF
    ```
    where;
    - `<apiserversource>` is the name of the source that you want to create.
    - `<namespace>` is the name of the namespace that you created in step 1 above.
    - `<service-account>` is the name of the service account that you created in step 2 above.
    - `<sink>` is the name of the Knative service that you want to use as a sink. A service is used here as an example, however you can use any supported PodSpecable object by updating the `kind` from `Service` to another object type.


=== "kn"

    ```shell
    kn source apiserver create <apiserversource> \
      --namespace <namespace> \
      --mode "Resource" \
      --resource "Event:v1" \
      --service-account <service-account> \
      --sink <sink>
    ```
    where;
    - `<apiserversource>` is the name of the source that you want to create.
    - `<namespace>` is the name of the namespace that you created in step 1 above.
    - `<service-account>` is the name of the service account that you created in step 2 above.
    - `<sink>` is the name of the PodSpecable object that you want to use as a sink.





6. Create events by launching a test pod in your namespace:

    ```shell
    kubectl run busybox --image=busybox --namespace=<namespace> --restart=Never -- ls
    ```
    where;
    - `<namespace>` is the name of the namespace that you created in step 1 above.

1. Delete the test pod:

    ```shell
    kubectl --namespace=<namespace> delete pod busybox
    ```
    where;
    - `<namespace>` is the name of the namespace that you created in step 1 above.

1. View the logs to verify that Kubernetes events were sent to the Knative Eventing system:

    ```shell
    kubectl logs --namespace=<namespace> -l app=<sink> --tail=100
    ```
    where;
    - `<namespace>` is the name of the namespace that you created in step 1 above.
    - `<sink>` is the name of the PodSpecable object that you used as a sink in step 5 above.

    Example log output:

    ```shell
    ☁️  cloudevents.Event

    Context Attributes,
      specversion: 1.0

      }
    ```
## Delete the API server source

Deleting the namespace removes the API server source and all of the related resources that were created in this namespace:

```shell
kubectl delete namespace <namespace>
```
where;
- `<namespace>` is the name of the namespace that you created in step 1 above.
