Event Sources are Kubernetes Custom Resources which provide a mechanism for registering interest in
a class of events from a particular software system. Since different event sources may be described
by different Custom Resources, this page provides an index of the available source resource types as
well as links to installation instructions.

This is a non-exhaustive list of Event sources for Knative.
