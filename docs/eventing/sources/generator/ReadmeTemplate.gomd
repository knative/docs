Event Sources are Kubernetes Custom Resources which provide a mechanism for registering interest in
a class of events from a particular software system. Since different event sources may be described
by different Custom Resources, this page provides an index of the available source resource types as
well as links to installation instructions.

For details how to write an Event Source consult one of the following tutorials:
* [Write an EventSource using ContainerSource](../write-event-source-easy-way)
* [Write an EventSource Controller](../write-event-source)

Below is a non-exhaustive list of Event sources for Knative.

### Inclusion in this list is not an endorsement, nor does it imply any level of support.


## Sources

These are sources that are installed as `CRD`s.

{{ range .Sources -}}
[{{ .Name }}]({{ .Url }}) | {{ .Status }} | {{ .Support }} | {{ .Description }}
{{- end }}


## Meta Sources

These are not directly usable, but make writing a Source much easier.

--- | --- | --- | ---
{{ range .MetaSources -}}
[{{ .Name }}]({{ .Url }}) | {{ .Status }} | {{ .Support }} | {{ .Description }}
{{- end }}
