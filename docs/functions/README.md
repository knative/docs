Knative Functions are the easiest path to get started with Knative.
They provide a foothold into the Knative architecture without requiring
you to learn Kubernetes or Knative concepts in detail.
Functions offer a programming model that leverages the Knative
Serving and Eventing APIs for a quick and easy method of deploying your
first Knative applications. You don't need to know anything
about Knative or even Kubernetes resources to get started.

While the `func` CLI has been optimized for the simplest path to deploying
a function, it is also flexible enough to support more advanced use cases.

Function lifecycle management includes creating, building, and deploying a
function. You can also test a deployed function by invoking it
locally or on a cluster. You can do all of these operations using the
[`func`](./install-func.md) command line interface. To learn more about
the `func` CLI, see the
[CLI reference](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/kn-plugin-func/blob/main/docs/reference/func.md){target=_blank}.
