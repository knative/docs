# Sourcing events

To create an event-driven architecture, the first step you must take is to determine where your events will come from.

Knative event sources make it possible for you to import events from many different types of event producers, and convert them automatically into CloudEvents. This enables events from your event producer to be passed through other Knative components, such as brokers and triggers, to your apps or services.
