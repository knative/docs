# Before you begin

Before you can get started with Knative you must set up a development environment.

## Set up a development cluster

You can use [`kind`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start){target=_blank} (Kubernetes in Docker) to run a local Kubernetes cluster with Docker container nodes.

## Install the Kubernetes CLI

The [Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl){target=_blank}, allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. You can use `kubectl` to deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources, and view logs.
