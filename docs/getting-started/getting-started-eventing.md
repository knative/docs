# About Knative Eventing

Knative Eventing provides you with helpful tools that can be used to create event-driven applications, by easily attaching event sources, triggers, and other options to your Knative Services.

Event-driven applications are designed to detect events as they occur, and process these events by using user-defined, event-handling procedures.

    To find out more about event-driven architecture and Knative Eventing, check out this CNCF Session about [event-driven architecture with Knative events](https://www.cncf.io/online-programs/event-driven-architecture-with-knative-events/){target=blank}

After you install Knative Eventing, you can create, send, and verify events. This tutorial shows how you can use a basic workflow for managing events that uses **Event Sources**, **Brokers**, **Triggers**, and **Sinks**.
