linkTitle: "Custom Install"
weight: 10
---

Use this guide to perform a custom installation of Knative on an existing
Kubernetes cluster. Knative's pluggable components allow you to install only
what you need.

The steps covered in this guide are for advanced operators who want to customize
each Knative installation. Installing individual Knative components requires
you to run multiple installation commands.

## Before you begin

- If you are new to Knative, you should instead
  [follow one of the platform-specific installation guides](./) to help
  you get up and running quickly.

- The steps in this guide use `bash` for the MacOS or Linux environment; for
  Windows, some commands might need adjustment.

- This guide assumes that you have an existing Kubernetes cluster, on which
  you're comfortable installing and running _alpha_ level software.

- Kubernetes requirements:

  - Your Kubernetes cluster version must be v1.11 or newer.

  - Your version of the
    [`kubectl` CLI tool](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
    must be v1.10 or newer.

## Installing Istio

Knative depends on [Istio](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/what-is-istio/) for
traffic routing and ingress. You have the option of injecting Istio sidecars and
enabling the Istio service mesh, but it's not required for all Knative
components.

You should first install the `istio-crds.yaml` file to ensure that the Istio
[Custom Resource Definitions (CRD)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)
are created before installing Istio.

### Choosing an Istio installation

You can Istio with or without a service mesh:

- _automatic sidecar injection_: Enables the Istio service mesh by
  [automatically injecting the Istio sidecars](https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/sidecar-injection/#automatic-sidecar-injection).
  The sidecars are injected into each pod of your cluster as each pod is
  created.

- _manual sidecar injection_: Provides your Knative installation with traffic
  routing and ingress, without the Istio service mesh. You do have the option of
  later enabling the service mesh if you
  [manually inject the Istio sidecars](https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/sidecar-injection/#manual-sidecar-injection).

If you are just getting started with Knative, you should choose automatic
sidecar injection and enable the Istio service mesh.

Due to current dependencies, some installable Knative options require the Istio
service mesh. If you install any of the following options, you must install
`istio.yaml` so that automatic sidecar injection is enabled:

- [Knative Eventing](https://github.com/knative/eventing)
- [Knative Eventing Sources](https://github.com/knative/eventing-sources)
- [Observability plugins](../serving/installing-logging-metrics-traces.md)

#### Istio installation options


| Istio Install Filename        | Description                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [`istio-crds.yaml`][a]†       | Creates CRDs before installing Istio.                                    |
| [`istio.yaml`][b]†            | Install Istio with service mesh enabled (automatic sidecar injection).   |
| [`istio-lean.yaml`][c]        | Install Istio and disable the service mesh by default.                   |

† These are the recommended standard install files suitable for most use cases.

[b]: https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.3.0/istio.yaml
[c]: https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.3.0/istio-lean.yaml

### Installing Istio

1. If you choose to install the Istio service mesh with automatic sidecar
   injection, you must ensure that the
   [`MutatingAdmissionWebhook` admission controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.11/#mutatingwebhookconfiguration-v1beta1-admissionregistration-k8s-io)
   is enabled on your cluster by running the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration
   ```

   Result:

   ```bash
   admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
   ```

   If `admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1` is not listed, follow the
   [Kubernetes instructions about enabling the `MutatingAdmissionWebhook` admission controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/admission-controllers/#how-do-i-turn-on-an-admission-controller).

   For example, you add `--enable-admission-plugins=MutatingAdmissionWebhook` to
   the `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` file.

1. Create the Istio CRDs on your cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply --filename https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.3.0/istio-crds.yaml
   ```

1. Install Istio by specifying the filename in the `kubectl apply` command:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply --filename https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.3.0/[FILENAME].yaml
   ```

   where `[FILENAME]` is the name of the Istio file that you want to install.
   Examples:

   - `istio.yaml`
   - `istio-lean.yaml`

1. If you chose to install the Istio service mesh with automatic sidecar
   injection, you must label the default namespace with
   `istio-injection=enabled`:

   ```bash
   kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
   ```

   Important: You should set the `istio-injection` namespace, if you intend on
   later enabling the Istio service mesh through manual sidecar injection.

1. View the status of your Istio installation. It might take a few seconds, so
   rerun the following command until all of the pods show a `STATUS` of
   `Running` or `Completed`:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods --namespace istio-system
   ```

   > Tip: You can append the `--watch` flag to the `kubectl get` commands to
   > view the pod status in realtime. You use `CTRL + C` to exit watch mode.

## Installing Knative components

Each Knative component must be installed individually. You can decide which
components and observability plugins to install based on what you plan to do
with Knative.

### Installing Knative

**Tip**: From the table above, copy and paste the URL and filename into the
commands below.

1. To install Knative components or plugins, specify the filenames in the
   `kubectl apply` command:

   - To install an individual component or plgugin

     ```bash
     kubectl apply --filename [FILE_URL]
     ```

   - To install multiple components or plugins, append additional
     `--filename [FILENAME]` flags to the `kubectl apply` command:

     ```bash
     kubectl apply --filename [FILE_URL] --filename [FILE_URL] \
       --filename [FILE_URL]
     ```

     where [`FILE_URL`] is the URL path of the desired Knative release:

     `https://github.com/knative/[COMPONENT]/releases/download/[VERSION]/[FILENAME].yaml`

     `[COMPONENT]`, `[VERSION]`, and `[FILENAME]` are the Knative component,
     release version, and filename of the Knative component or plugin. Examples:

     - `https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.3.0/serving.yaml`
     - `https://github.com/knative/build/releases/download/v0.3.0/release.yaml`
     - `https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases/download/v0.3.0/release.yaml`
     - `https://github.com/knative/eventing-sources/releases/download/v0.3.0/release.yaml`


    **Example install commands:**

     * To install the Knative Serving component with the set of observability plug-ins:

       ```bash
       kubectl apply --filename https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.3.0/serving.yaml \
       --filename https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.3.0/monitoring.yaml
       ```

    * To install all three Knative components and the set of Eventing sources without an observability plugin:

      ```bash
      kubectl apply --filename https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.3.0/serving.yaml \
      --filename https://github.com/knative/build/releases/download/v0.3.0/release.yaml \
      --filename https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases/download/v0.3.0/release.yaml \
      --filename https://github.com/knative/eventing-sources/releases/download/v0.3.0/release.yaml
      ```

1. Depending on what you chose to install, view the status of your
   installation by running one or more of the following commands. It might take
   a few seconds, so rerun the commands until all of the components show a
   `STATUS` of `Running`:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods --namespace knative-serving
   kubectl get pods --namespace knative-build
   kubectl get pods --namespace knative-eventing
   kubectl get pods --namespace knative-sources
   ```

   > Tip: You can append the `--watch` flag to the `kubectl get` commands to
   > view the pod status in realtime. You use `CTRL + C` to exit watch mode.

1. If you installed an observability plugin, run the following command to ensure
   that the necessary `knative-monitoring` pods show a `STATUS` of `Running`:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods --namespace knative-monitoring
   ```

   See 
   [Installing logging, metrics, and traces](../serving/installing-logging-metrics-traces.md)
   for details about setting up the various supported observability plug-ins.

You are now ready to deploy an app, run a build, or start sending and
receiving events in your Knative cluster.
