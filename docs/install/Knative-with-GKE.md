This guide walks you through the installation of the latest version of all
Knative components using pre-built images.

You can find [guides for other platforms here](README.md).

## Before you begin

Knative requires a Kubernetes cluster v1.11 or newer. `kubectl` v1.10 is also
required. This guide walks you through creating a cluster with the correct
specifications for Knative on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

This guide assumes you are using `bash` in a Mac or Linux environment; some
commands will need to be adjusted for use in a Windows environment.

### Installing the Google Cloud SDK and `kubectl`

1. If you already have `gcloud` installed with `kubectl` version 1.10 or newer,
   you can skip these steps.

   > Tip: To check which version of `kubectl` you have installed, enter:

   ```
   kubectl version
   ```

1. Download and install the `gcloud` command line tool:
   https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install

1. Install the `kubectl` component:
   ```
   gcloud components install kubectl
   ```
1. Authorize `gcloud`:
   ```
   gcloud auth login
   ```

### Setting environment variables

To simplify the command lines for this walkthrough, we need to define a few
environment variables.

Set `CLUSTER_NAME` and `CLUSTER_ZONE` variables, you can replace `knative` and
`us-west1-c` with cluster name and zone of your choosing.

The `CLUSTER_NAME` needs to be lowercase and unique among any other Kubernetes
clusters in your GCP project. The zone can be
[any compute zone available on GCP](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/#available).
These variables are used later to create a Kubernetes cluster.

```bash
export CLUSTER_NAME=knative
export CLUSTER_ZONE=us-west1-c
```

### Setting up a Google Cloud Platform project

You need a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project to create a Google Kubernetes
Engine cluster.

1. Set `PROJECT` environment variable, you can replace `my-knative-project` with
   the desired name of your GCP project. If you don't have one, we'll create one
   in the next step.
   ```bash
   export PROJECT=my-knative-project
   ```
1. If you don't have a GCP project, create and set it as your `gcloud` default:

   ```bash
   gcloud projects create $PROJECT --set-as-default
   ```

   You also need to
   [enable billing](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/manage-billing-account)
   for your new project.

1. If you already have a GCP project, make sure your project is set as your
   `gcloud` default:

   ```bash
   gcloud config set core/project $PROJECT
   ```

   > Tip: Enter `gcloud config get-value project` to view the ID of your default
   > GCP project.

1. Enable the necessary APIs:
   ```bash
   gcloud services enable \
     cloudapis.googleapis.com \
     container.googleapis.com \
     containerregistry.googleapis.com
   ```

## Creating a Kubernetes cluster

To make sure the cluster is large enough to host all the Knative and Istio
components, the recommended configuration for a cluster is:

- Kubernetes version 1.11 or later
- 4 vCPU nodes (`n1-standard-4`)
- Node autoscaling, up to 10 nodes
- API scopes for `cloud-platform`, `logging-write`, `monitoring-write`, and
  `pubsub` (if those features will be used)

1. Create a Kubernetes cluster on GKE with the required specifications:
   ```bash
   gcloud container clusters create $CLUSTER_NAME \
     --zone=$CLUSTER_ZONE \
     --cluster-version=latest \
     --machine-type=n1-standard-4 \
     --enable-autoscaling --min-nodes=1 --max-nodes=10 \
     --enable-autorepair \
     --scopes=service-control,service-management,compute-rw,storage-ro,cloud-platform,logging-write,monitoring-write,pubsub,datastore \
     --num-nodes=3
   ```
1. Grant cluster-admin permissions to the current user:
   ```bash
   kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding \
   --clusterrole=cluster-admin \
   --user=$(gcloud config get-value core/account)
   ```

Admin permissions are required to create the necessary
[RBAC rules for Istio](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/security/rbac/).

## Installing Istio

Knative depends on Istio.

1. Install Istio:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply --filename https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.3.0/istio-crds.yaml && \
   kubectl apply --filename https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.3.0/istio.yaml
   ```
   Note: the resources (CRDs) defined in the `istio-crds.yaml`file are
   also included in the `istio.yaml` file, but they are pulled out so that
   the CRD definitions are created first. If you see an error when creating
   resources about an unknown type, run the second `kubectl apply` command
   again.

1. Label the default namespace with `istio-injection=enabled`:
   ```bash
   kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
   ```
1. Monitor the Istio components until all of the components show a `STATUS` of
   `Running` or `Completed`:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods --namespace istio-system
   ```

It will take a few minutes for all the components to be up and running; you can
rerun the command to see the current status.

> Note: Instead of rerunning the command, you can add `--watch` to the above
> command to view the component's status updates in real time. Use CTRL + C to
> exit watch mode.

## Installing Knative

The following commands install all available Knative components as well as the
standard set of observability plugins. To customize your Knative installation,
see [Performing a Custom Knative Installation](Knative-custom-install.md).

1. Run the `kubectl apply` command to install Knative and its dependencies:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply --filename https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.3.0/serving.yaml \
    --filename https://github.com/knative/build/releases/download/v0.3.0/release.yaml \
    --filename https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases/download/v0.3.0/release.yaml \
    --filename https://github.com/knative/eventing-sources/releases/download/v0.3.0/release.yaml \
    --filename https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.3.0/monitoring.yaml
    ```
1. Monitor the Knative components until all of the components show a
   `STATUS` of `Running`:
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods --namespace knative-serving
    kubectl get pods --namespace knative-build
    kubectl get pods --namespace knative-eventing
    kubectl get pods --namespace knative-sources
    kubectl get pods --namespace knative-monitoring
    ```

## What's next

Now that your cluster has Knative installed, you can see what Knative has to
offer.

To deploy your first app with Knative, follow the step-by-step
[Getting Started with Knative App Deployment](getting-started-knative-app.md)
guide.

To get started with Knative Eventing, pick one of the
[Eventing Samples](../eventing/samples/) to walk through.

To get started with Knative Build, read the
[Build README](../build/README.md), then choose a sample to walk through.

## Cleaning up

Running a cluster in Kubernetes Engine costs money, so you might want to delete
the cluster when you're done if you're not using it. Deleting the cluster will
also remove Knative, Istio, and any apps you've deployed.

To delete the cluster, enter the following command:

```bash
gcloud container clusters delete $CLUSTER_NAME --zone $CLUSTER_ZONE
```
