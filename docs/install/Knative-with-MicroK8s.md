[MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io) is a lightweight, powerful fully-conformant Kubernetes that tracks upstream releases and makes clustering trivial. It can run on any flavor of Linux that supports [Snap](https://snapcraft.io) packages. It can run on Windows and Mac OS using [Mutlipass](https://multipass.run).
This guide walks you through the installation of Knative using MicroK8s.

If you need help or support please reach out on the [Kubernetes forum](https://discuss.kubernetes.io/tags/microk8s) or Kubernetes.slack.com channel #microk8s.
Additionally if you wish to contribute or report an issue please visit [MicroK8s Github](https://github.com/ubuntu/microk8s).

You can find [guides for other platforms here](./README.md).
