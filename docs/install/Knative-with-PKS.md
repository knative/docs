This guide walks you through the installation of the latest version of Knative
using pre-built images.

You can find [guides for other platforms here](../).

## Before you begin

Knative requires a Kubernetes cluster v1.11 or newer. `kubectl` v1.10 is also
required. This guide walks you through creating a cluster with the correct
specifications for Knative on Pivotal Container Service.

This guide assumes you are using bash in a Mac or Linux environment; some
commands will need to be adjusted for use in a Windows environment.

### Installing Pivotal Container Service

To install Pivotal Container Service (PKS), follow the documentation at
https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-1/installing-pks.html.

## Creating a Kubernetes cluster

> NOTE: Knative uses Istio sidecar injection and requires privileged mode for
> your init containers.

To enable privileged mode and create a cluster:

1. Enable privileged mode:
   1. Open the Pivotal Container Service tile in PCF Ops Manager.
   1. In the plan configuration that you want to use, enable both of the
      following:
      - Enable Privileged Containers - Use with caution
      - Disable DenyEscalatingExec
   1. Save your changes.
   1. In the PCF Ops Manager, review and then apply your changes.
1. [Create a cluster](https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-1/create-cluster.html).

## Access the cluster

To retrieve your cluster credentials, follow the documentation at
https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-1/cluster-credentials.html.

## Installing Istio

Knative depends on Istio. Istio workloads require privileged mode for Init
Containers

1. Install Istio:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply --filename https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.3.0/istio-crds.yaml && \
   kubectl apply --filename https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.3.0/istio.yaml
   ```
   Note: the resources (CRDs) defined in the `istio-crds.yaml`file are
   also included in the `istio.yaml` file, but they are pulled out so that
   the CRD definitions are created first. If you see an error when creating
   resources about an unknown type, run the second `kubectl apply` command
   again.

1. Label the default namespace with `istio-injection=enabled`:
   ```bash
   kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
   ```
1. Monitor the Istio components until all of the components show a `STATUS` of
   `Running` or `Completed`: `bash kubectl get pods --namespace istio-system`

It will take a few minutes for all the components to be up and running; you can
rerun the command to see the current status.

> Note: Instead of rerunning the command, you can add `--watch` to the above
> command to view the component's status updates in real time. Use CTRL + C to
> exit watch mode.

## Installing Knative

The following commands install all available Knative components as well as the
standard set of observability plugins. To customize your Knative installation,
see [Performing a Custom Knative Installation](Knative-custom-install.md).

1. Run the `kubectl apply` command to install Knative and its dependencies:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply --filename https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.3.0/serving.yaml \
    --filename https://github.com/knative/build/releases/download/v0.3.0/release.yaml \
    --filename https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases/download/v0.3.0/release.yaml \
    --filename https://github.com/knative/eventing-sources/releases/download/v0.3.0/release.yaml
    ```
1. Monitor the Knative components until all of the components show a
   `STATUS` of `Running`:
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods --namespace knative-serving
    kubectl get pods --namespace knative-build
    kubectl get pods --namespace knative-eventing
    kubectl get pods --namespace knative-sources
    kubectl get pods --namespace knative-monitoring
    ```

## What's next

Now that your cluster has Knative installed, you can see what Knative has to
offer.

To deploy your first app with Knative, follow the step-by-step
[Getting Started with Knative App Deployment](getting-started-knative-app.md)
guide.

To get started with Knative Eventing, pick one of the
[Eventing Samples](../eventing/samples/) to walk through.

To get started with Knative Build, read the
[Build README](../build/), then choose a sample to walk through.

## Cleaning up

To delete the cluster, follow the documentation at
https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-1/delete-cluster.html.
