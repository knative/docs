This guide walks you through the installation of the latest version of Knative
using pre-built images.

## Before you begin

Knative requires a Kubernetes cluster v1.11 or newer with the
[MutatingAdmissionWebhook admission controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#how-do-i-turn-on-an-admission-controller)
enabled. `kubectl` v1.10 is also required. This guide assumes that you've
already created a Kubernetes cluster which you're comfortable installing _alpha_
software on.

This guide assumes you are using bash in a Mac or Linux environment; some
commands will need to be adjusted for use in a Windows environment.

## Installing Istio

Knative depends on Istio. If your cloud platform offers a managed Istio
installation, we recommend installing Istio that way, unless you need the
ability to customize your installation. For example, the
[GKE Install Guide](./knative-with-gke.md) includes the instructions for
installing Istio on your cluster using `gcloud`.

If you prefer to install Istio manually, if your cloud provider doesn't offer a
managed Istio installation, or if you're installing Knative locally using
Minkube or similar, see the
[Installing Istio for Knative guide](./installing-istio.md).

You must install Istio on your Kubernetes cluster before continuing with these
instructions to install Knative.

## Installing Knative

The following commands install all available Knative components. To customize
your Knative installation, see
[Performing a Custom Knative Installation](./Knative-custom-install.md).

1. If you are upgrading from Knative 0.3.x: Update your domain and static IP
   address to be associated with the LoadBalancer `istio-ingressgateway` instead
   of `knative-ingressgateway`. Then run the following to clean up leftover
   resources:

   ```bash
   kubectl delete svc knative-ingressgateway -n istio-system
   kubectl delete deploy knative-ingressgateway -n istio-system
   ```

   If you have the Knative Eventing Sources component installed, you will also
   need to delete the following resource before upgrading:

   ```
   kubectl delete statefulset/controller-manager -n knative-sources
   ```

   While the deletion of this resource during the upgrade process will not
   prevent modifications to Eventing Source resources, those changes will not be
   completed until the upgrade process finishes.

1. To install Knative, first install the CRDs by running the `kubectl apply`
   command once with the `-l knative.dev/crd-install=true` flag. This prevents
   race conditions during the install, which cause intermittent errors:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply --selector knative.dev/crd-install=true \
   --filename https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.7.0/serving.yaml \
   --filename https://github.com/knative/build/releases/download/v0.7.0/build.yaml \
   --filename https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases/download/v0.7.0/release.yaml \
   --filename https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.7.0/monitoring.yaml
   ```

1. To complete the install of Knative and its dependencies, run the
   `kubectl apply` command again, this time without the `--selector` flag, to
   complete the install of Knative and its dependencies:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply --filename https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.7.0/serving.yaml --selector networking.knative.dev/certificate-provider!=cert-manager \
   --filename https://github.com/knative/build/releases/download/v0.7.0/build.yaml \
   --filename https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases/download/v0.7.0/release.yaml \
   --filename https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.7.0/monitoring.yaml
   ```

   > **Notes**:
   >
   > - By default, the Knative Serving component installation (`serving.yaml`)
   >   includes a controller for
   >   [enabling automatic TLS certificate provisioning](../serving/using-auto-tls.md).
   >   If you do intend on immediately enabling auto certificates in Knative,
   >   you can remove the
   >   `--selector networking.knative.dev/certificate-provider!=cert-manager`
   >   statement to install the controller. Otherwise, you can choose to install
   >   the auto certificates feature and controller at a later time.

1. Monitor the Knative components until all of the components show a `STATUS` of
   `Running`:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods --namespace knative-serving
   kubectl get pods --namespace knative-build
   kubectl get pods --namespace knative-eventing
   kubectl get pods --namespace knative-monitoring
   ```

## What's next

Now that your cluster has Knative installed, you can see what Knative has to
offer.

To deploy your first app with Knative, follow the step-by-step
[Getting Started with Knative App Deployment](./getting-started-knative-app.md)
guide.

To get started with Knative Eventing, pick one of the
[Eventing Samples](../eventing/samples/) to walk through.

To get started with Knative Build, read the [Build README](../build/README.md),
then choose a sample to walk through.
