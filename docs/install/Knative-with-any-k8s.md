This guide walks you through the installation of the latest version of Knative
using pre-built images.

## Before you begin

Knative requires a Kubernetes cluster v1.11 or newer with the
[MutatingAdmissionWebhook admission controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#how-do-i-turn-on-an-admission-controller)
enabled. `kubectl` v1.10 is also required. This guide assumes that you've
already created a Kubernetes cluster which you're comfortable installing _alpha_
software on.

This guide assumes you are using bash in a Mac or Linux environment; some
commands will need to be adjusted for use in a Windows environment.

## Installing Istio

Knative depends on Istio. Istio workloads require privileged mode for Init
Containers.

1.  Install Istio:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply --filename https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.3.0/istio-crds.yaml && \
    kubectl apply --filename https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.3.0/istio.yaml
    ```
    Note: the resources (CRDs) defined in the `istio-crds.yaml`file are
    also included in the `istio.yaml` file, but they are pulled out so that
    the CRD definitions are created first. If you see an error when creating
    resources about an unknown type, run the second `kubectl apply` command
    again.

1.  Label the default namespace with `istio-injection=enabled`:
    ```bash
    kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
    ```
1.  Monitor the Istio components until all of the components show a `STATUS` of
    `Running` or `Completed`:
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods --namespace istio-system
    ```

It will take a few minutes for all the components to be up and running; you can
rerun the command to see the current status.

> Note: Instead of rerunning the command, you can add `--watch` to the above
> command to view the component's status updates in real time. Use CTRL + C to
> exit watch mode.

## Installing Knative

The following commands install all available Knative components. To customize
your Knative installation, see [Performing a Custom Knative Installation](Knative-custom-install.md).

1. Run the `kubectl apply` command to install Knative and its dependencies:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply --filename https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.3.0/serving.yaml \
    --filename https://github.com/knative/build/releases/download/v0.3.0/release.yaml \
    --filename https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases/download/v0.3.0/release.yaml \
    --filename https://github.com/knative/eventing-sources/releases/download/v0.3.0/release.yaml \
    --filename https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.3.0/monitoring.yaml
    ```
1. Monitor the Knative components until all of the components show a
   `STATUS` of `Running`:
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods --namespace knative-serving
    kubectl get pods --namespace knative-build
    kubectl get pods --namespace knative-eventing
    kubectl get pods --namespace knative-sources
    kubectl get pods --namespace knative-monitoring
    ```

## What's next

Now that your cluster has Knative installed, you can see what Knative has to
offer.

To deploy your first app with Knative, follow the step-by-step
[Getting Started with Knative App Deployment](getting-started-knative-app.md)
guide.

To get started with Knative Eventing, pick one of the
[Eventing Samples](../eventing/samples/) to walk through.

To get started with Knative Build, read the
[Build README](../build/), then choose a sample to walk through.
