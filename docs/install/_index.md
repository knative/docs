# Installing Knative

You can install the Serving component, Eventing component, or both on your cluster by using one of the following deployment options:

- Using a [YAML-based installation](./prerequisites)
- Using the [Knative Operator](./knative-with-operators).
- Following the documentation for vendor managed [Knative offerings](../knative-offerings).

You can also [upgrade an existing Knative installation](./upgrade-installation).

**NOTE:** Knative installation instructions assume you are running Mac or Linux with a bash shell.
<!-- TODO: Link to provisioning guide for advanced installation -->

## Next steps

- Install the [Knative CLI](../client/install-kn) to use `kn` commands.
