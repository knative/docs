# kn plugins

The `kn` CLI supports the use of plugins. Plugins enable you to extend the functionality of your `kn` installation by adding custom commands and other shared commands that are not part of the core distribution of `kn`.

!!! warning
    The plugins must be named with the prefix `kn-` to be detected by `kn`. For example, `kn-func` will be detected but `func` won't be detected.

<!--TODO: Add details about installing and using different available plugins, list of available plugins-->
