This guide shows you how to deploy an app using Knative, then interact with it
using cURL requests.

## Before you begin

You need:

- A Kubernetes cluster with [Knative installed](./README.md).
- An image of the app that you'd like to deploy available on a container
  registry. The image of the sample app used in this guide is available on
  Google Container Registry.

## Sample application

This guide uses the
[Hello World sample app in Go](../serving/samples/hello-world/helloworld-go) to
demonstrate the basic workflow for deploying an app, but these steps can be
adapted for your own application if you have an image of it available on
[Docker Hub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/),
[Google Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/pushing-and-pulling),
or another container image registry.

The Hello World sample app reads in an `env` variable, `TARGET`, from the
configuration `.yaml` file, then prints "Hello World: \${TARGET}!". If `TARGET`
isn't defined, it will print "NOT SPECIFIED".

## Configuring your deployment

To deploy an app using Knative, you need a configuration `.yaml` file that
defines a Service. For more information about the Service object, see the
[Resource Types documentation](https://github.com/knative/serving/blob/master/docs/spec/overview.md#service).

This configuration file specifies metadata about the application, points to the
hosted image of the app for deployment, and allows the deployment to be
configured. For more information about what configuration options are available,
see the
[Serving spec documentation](https://github.com/knative/serving/blob/master/docs/spec/spec.md).

Create a new file named `service.yaml`, then copy and paste the following
content into it:

```yaml
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1 # Current version of Knative
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: helloworld-go # The name of the app
  namespace: default # The namespace the app will use
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: gcr.io/knative-samples/helloworld-go # The URL to the image of the app
        env:
          - name: TARGET # The environment variable printed out by the sample app
            value: "Go Sample v1"
```

If you want to deploy the sample app, leave the config file as-is. If you're
deploying an image of your own app, update the name of the app and the URL of
the image accordingly.

## Deploying your app

From the directory where the new `service.yaml` file was created, apply the
configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply --filename service.yaml
```

Now that your service is created, Knative will perform the following steps:

- Create a new immutable revision for this version of the app.
- Perform network programming to create a route, ingress, service, and load
  balancer for your app.
- Automatically scale your pods up and down based on traffic, including to zero
  active pods.

### Interacting with your app

To see if your app has been deployed successfully, you need the host URL and IP
address created by Knative.

Note: If your cluster is new, it can take some time before the service is
assigned an external IP address.

1. To find the IP address for your service, enter:

   ```shell
   # In Knative 0.2.x and prior versions, the `knative-ingressgateway` service was used instead of `istio-ingressgateway`.
   INGRESSGATEWAY=knative-ingressgateway

   # The use of `knative-ingressgateway` is deprecated in Knative v0.3.x.
   # Use `istio-ingressgateway` instead, since `knative-ingressgateway`
   # will be removed in Knative v0.4.
   if kubectl get configmap config-istio -n knative-serving &> /dev/null; then
       INGRESSGATEWAY=istio-ingressgateway
   fi

   kubectl get svc $INGRESSGATEWAY --namespace istio-system

   NAME                     TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)                                      AGE
   istio-ingressgateway   LoadBalancer   10.23.247.74   35.203.155.229   80:32380/TCP,443:32390/TCP,32400:32400/TCP   2d
   ```

   Take note of the `EXTERNAL-IP` address.

   You can also export the IP address as a variable with the following command:

   ```shell
   export IP_ADDRESS=$(kubectl get svc $INGRESSGATEWAY --namespace istio-system --output 'jsonpath={.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
   ```

   > Note: if you use minikube or a baremetal cluster that has no external load
   > balancer, the `EXTERNAL-IP` field is shown as `<pending>`. You need to use
   > `NodeIP` and `NodePort` to interact your app instead. To get your app's
   > `NodeIP` and `NodePort`, enter the following command:

   ```shell
   export IP_ADDRESS=$(kubectl get node  --output 'jsonpath={.items[0].status.addresses[0].address}'):$(kubectl get svc $INGRESSGATEWAY --namespace istio-system   --output 'jsonpath={.spec.ports[?(@.port==80)].nodePort}')
   ```

1. To find the host URL for your service, enter:

   ```shell
   kubectl get route helloworld-go  --output=custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,DOMAIN:.status.domain
   NAME                DOMAIN
   helloworld-go       helloworld-go.default.example.com
   ```

   You can also export the host URL as a variable using the following command:

   ```shell
   export HOST_URL=$(kubectl get route helloworld-go  --output jsonpath='{.status.domain}')
   ```

   If you changed the name from `helloworld-go` to something else when creating
   the `.yaml` file, replace `helloworld-go` in the above commands with the name
   you entered.

1. Now you can make a request to your app and see the results. Replace
   `IP_ADDRESS` with the `EXTERNAL-IP` you wrote down, and replace
   `helloworld-go.default.example.com` with the domain returned in the previous
   step.

   ```shell
   curl -H "Host: helloworld-go.default.example.com" http://${IP_ADDRESS}
   Hello World: Go Sample v1!
   ```

   If you exported the host URL and IP address as variables in the previous
   steps, you can use those variables to simplify your cURL request:

   ```shell
   curl -H "Host: ${HOST_URL}" http://${IP_ADDRESS}
   Hello World: Go Sample v1!
   ```

   If you deployed your own app, you might want to customize this cURL request
   to interact with your application.

   It can take a few seconds for Knative to scale up your application and return
   a response.

   > Note: Add `-v` option to get more detail if the `curl` command failed.

You've successfully deployed your first application using Knative!

## Cleaning up

To remove the sample app from your cluster, delete the service record:

```shell
kubectl delete --filename service.yaml
```
