# Installing Istio for Knative

This guide walks you through manually installing and customizing Istio for use
with Knative.

If your cloud platform offers a managed Istio installation, we recommend
installing Istio that way, unless you need to customize your
installation.

## Before you begin

You need:

- A Kubernetes cluster created.
- [`istioctl`](https://istio.io/docs/setup/install/istioctl/) installed.

## Supported Istio versions

You can view the latest tested Istio version on the [Knative Net Istio releases page](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-istio/releases).

## Installing Istio

When you install Istio, there are a few options depending on your goals. For a
basic Istio installation suitable for most Knative use cases, follow the
[Installing Istio without sidecar injection](#installing-istio-without-sidecar-injection)
instructions. If you're familiar with Istio and know what kind of installation
you want, read through the options and choose the installation that suits your
needs.

You can easily customize your Istio installation with `istioctl`. The following sections
cover a few useful Istio configurations and their benefits.

### Choosing an Istio installation

You can install Istio with or without a service mesh:

- [Installing Istio without sidecar injection](#installing-istio-without-sidecar-injection) (Recommended
     default installation)

- [Installing Istio with sidecar injection](#installing-istio-with-sidecar-injection)

If you want to get up and running with Knative quickly, we recommend installing
Istio without automatic sidecar injection. This install is also recommended for
users who don't need the Istio service mesh, or who want to enable the service
mesh by [manually injecting the Istio sidecars][1].

#### Installing Istio without sidecar injection

Enter the following command to install Istio:

To install Istio without sidecar injection:

```sh
istioctl install -y
```

#### Installing Istio with sidecar injection

If you want to enable the Istio service mesh, you must enable [automatic sidecar
injection][2]. The Istio service mesh provides a few benefits:

- Allows you to turn on [mutual TLS][3], which secures service-to-service
  traffic within the cluster.

- Allows you to use the [Istio authorization policy][4], controlling the access
  to each Knative service based on Istio service roles.

For automatic sidecar injection, set `autoInject: enabled` in addition to the earlier
operator configuration.

```
    global:
      proxy:
        autoInject: enabled
```

#### Using Istio mTLS feature

Since there are some networking communications between knative-serving namespace
and the namespace where your services running on, you need additional
preparations for mTLS enabled environment.

1. Enable sidecar container on `knative-serving` system namespace.

    ```bash
    kubectl label namespace knative-serving istio-injection=enabled
    ```

1. Set `PeerAuthentication` to `PERMISSIVE` on knative-serving system namespace
by creating a YAML file using the following template:

    ```bash
    apiVersion: "security.istio.io/v1beta1"
    kind: "PeerAuthentication"
    metadata:
      name: "default"
      namespace: "knative-serving"
    spec:
      mtls:
        mode: PERMISSIVE
    ```

1. Apply the YAML file by running the command:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f <filename>.yaml
    ```
    Where `<filename>` is the name of the file you created in the previous step.

After you install the cluster local gateway, your service and deployment for the local gateway is named `knative-local-gateway`.

### Updating the `config-istio` configmap to use a non-default local gateway

If you create a custom service and deployment for local gateway with a name other than `knative-local-gateway`, you
need to update gateway configmap `config-istio` under the `knative-serving` namespace.

1. Edit the `config-istio` configmap:

    ```bash
    kubectl edit configmap config-istio -n knative-serving
    ```

2. Replace the `local-gateway.knative-serving.knative-local-gateway` field with the custom service. As an example, if you name both
the service and deployment `custom-local-gateway` under the namespace `istio-system`, it should be updated to:

    ```
    custom-local-gateway.istio-system.svc.cluster.local
    ```

As an example, if both the custom service and deployment are labeled with `custom: custom-local-gateway`, not the default
`istio: knative-local-gateway`, you must update gateway instance `knative-local-gateway` in the `knative-serving` namespace:

```bash
kubectl edit gateway knative-local-gateway -n knative-serving
```

Replace the label selector with the label of your service:

```
istio: knative-local-gateway
```

For the service mentioned earlier, it should be updated to:

```
custom: custom-local-gateway
```

If there is a change in service ports (compared to that of
`knative-local-gateway`), update the port info in the gateway accordingly.

### Verifying your Istio install

View the status of your Istio installation to make sure the install was
successful. It might take a few seconds, so rerun the following command until
all of the pods show a `STATUS` of `Running` or `Completed`:

```bash
kubectl get pods --namespace istio-system
```
!!! tip
    You can append the `--watch` flag to the `kubectl get` commands to view
    the pod status in realtime. You use `CTRL + C` to exit watch mode.

### Configuring DNS

Knative dispatches to different services based on their hostname, so it is recommended to have DNS properly configured.

To do this, begin by looking up the external IP address that Istio received:

```
$ kubectl get svc -nistio-system
NAME                    TYPE           CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)                                      AGE
istio-ingressgateway    LoadBalancer   10.0.2.24    34.83.80.117   15020:32206/TCP,80:30742/TCP,443:30996/TCP   2m14s
istio-pilot             ClusterIP      10.0.3.27    <none>         15010/TCP,15011/TCP,8080/TCP,15014/TCP       2m14s
```

This external IP can be used with your DNS provider with a wildcard `A` record. However, for a basic non-production set
up, this external IP address can be used with `sslip.io` in the `config-domain` ConfigMap in `knative-serving`.

You can edit this by using the following command:

```
kubectl edit cm config-domain --namespace knative-serving
```

Given this external IP, change the content to:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: config-domain
  namespace: knative-serving
data:
  # sslip.io is a "magic" DNS provider, which resolves all DNS lookups for:
  # *.{ip}.sslip.io to {ip}.
  34.83.80.117.sslip.io: ""
```
