The Knative Eventing operator can be configured with these options:

- [Eventing Configuration by ConfigMap](#eventing-configuration-by-configMap)
- [Private repository and private secret](#private-repository-and-private-secrets)
- [Configuring default broker class](#configuring-default-broker-class)

__NOTE:__ Kubernetes spec level policies cannot be configured using the Knative operators.

## Eventing Configuration by ConfigMap

The Knative Eventing operator CR is configured the same way as the Knative Serving operator CR. Because the operator manages
the Knative Eventing installation, it will overwrite any updates to the `ConfigMaps` which are used to configure Knative
Eventing. The `KnativeEventing` custom resource allows you to set values for these ConfigMaps via the operator. Knative
Eventing has multiple ConfigMaps named with the prefix `config-`. The `spec.config` in `KnativeEventing` has one entry
`<name>` for each ConfigMap named `config-<name>`, with a value which will be used for the ConfigMap's `data`.

For example, if you would like to change your default channel from `InMemoryChannel` into `KafkaChannel`, here is what
your Eventing CR looks like, to modify the ConfigMap `config-br-default-channel`:

```
apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: KnativeEventing
metadata:
  name: knative-eventing
  namespace: knative-eventing
spec:
  config:
    br-default-channel:
      channelTemplateSpec: |
        apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1beta1
        kind: KafkaChannel
        spec:
          numPartitions: 10
          replicationFactor: 1
```

All the ConfigMaps are created in the same namespace as the operator CR. You can use the operator CR as the unique entry
point to edit all of them.

## Private repository and private secrets

The Knative Eventing operator CR is configured the same way as the Knative Serving operator CR. For more information,
see the documentation on “[Private repository and private secret](configuring-serving-cr.md#private-repository-and-private-secrets)” in Serving operator for detailed instruction.

Knative Eventing also specifies only one container within one `Deployment` resource. However, the container does not use
the same name as its parent `Deployment`, which means the container name in Knative Eventing is not the unique identifier
as in Knative Serving. Here is the list of containers within each `Deployment` resource:

| Component | Deployment name | Container name |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Core eventing | `eventing-controller` | `eventing-controller` |
| Core eventing | `eventing-webhook` | `eventing-webhook` |
| Eventing Broker | `broker-controller` | `eventing-controller` |
| In-Memory Channel | `imc-controller` | `controller` |
| In-Memory Channel | `imc-dispatcher` | `dispatcher` |

The `default` field can still be used to replace the images in a predefined format. However, if the container name is not
a unique identifier, e.g. `eventing-controller`, you need to use the `override` field to replace it, by specifying
`deployment/container` as the unique key.

Some images are defined via environment variable in Knative Eventing. They can be replaced by taking advantage of the
`override` field. As Knative does not have a consistent way to specify container images, we have a known issue [here](https://github.com/knative/operator/issues/22).

### Download images in predefined format without secrets:

This example shows how you can define custom image links that can be defined in the CR using the simplified format
`docker.io/knative-images/${NAME}:{CUSTOM-TAG}`.

In the example below:

- the custom tag `v0.13.0` is used for all images
- all image links are accessible without using secrets
- images are defined in the accepted format `docker.io/knative-images/${NAME}:{CUSTOM-TAG}`

First, you need to make sure your images are pushed to the following image tags:

| Deployment | Container | Docker image |
|----|----|----|
| `eventing-controller` | `eventing-controller` | `docker.io/knative-images/eventing-controller:v0.13.0` |
|  | `eventing-webhook` | `docker.io/knative-images/eventing-webhook:v0.13.0` |
| `broker-controller` | `eventing-controller` | `docker.io/knative-images/broker-eventing-controller:v0.13.0` |
|  | `controller` | `docker.io/knative-images/controller:v0.13.0` |
|  | `dispatcher` | `docker.io/knative-images/dispatcher:v0.13.0` |

Then, you need to define your operator CR with following content:

```
apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: KnativeEventing
metadata:
  name: knative-eventing
  namespace: knative-eventing
spec:
  registry:
    default: docker.io/knative-images/${NAME}:v0.13.0
    override:
      broker-controller/eventing-controller: docker.io/knative-images-repo1/broker-eventing-controller:v0.13.0
```

As indicated, you replace `{CUSTOM-TAG}` with the custom tag `v0.13.0`. `${NAME}` maps to the container name in each `Deployment` resource.
The field `default` is used to define the image format for all containers, except the container `eventing-controller` in
the deployment `broker-controller`. To replace the image for this container, you need to take advatage of the `override`
field to specify individually, by using `broker-controller/eventing-controller` as the key`.

### Download images from different repositories without secrets:

If your custom image links are not defined in a uniform format by default, you will need to individually include each
link in the CR.

For example, to define the list of images:

| Deployment | Container | Docker Image |
|----|----|----|
| `eventing-controller` | `eventing-controller` | `docker.io/knative-images/eventing-controller:v0.13.0` |
|  | `eventing-webhook` | `docker.io/knative-images/eventing-webhook:v0.13.0` |
|  | `controller` | `docker.io/knative-images/controller:v0.13.0` |
|  | `dispatcher` | `docker.io/knative-images/dispatcher:v0.13.0` |
| `broker-controller` | `eventing-controller` | `docker.io/knative-images/broker-eventing-controller:v0.13.0` |


The operator CR should be modified to include the full list:

```
apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: KnativeEventing
metadata:
  name: knative-eventing
  namespace: knative-eventing
spec:
  registry:
    override:
      eventing-controller/eventing-controller: docker.io/knative-images-repo1/eventing-controller:v0.13.0
      eventing-webhook/eventing-webhook: docker.io/knative-images-repo2/eventing-webhook:v0.13.0
      imc-controller/controller: docker.io/knative-images-repo3/imc-controller:v0.13.0
      imc-dispatcher/dispatcher: docker.io/knative-images-repo4/imc-dispatcher:v0.13.0
      broker-controller/eventing-controller: docker.io/knative-images-repo5/broker-eventing-controller:v0.13.0
```

If you would like to replace the image defined by environment variable, e.g. the envorinment variable `DISPATCHER_IMAGE`
in the container `controller` of the deployment `imc-controller`, you need to adjust your CR into the following, if the
target image is `docker.io/knative-images-repo5/DISPATCHER_IMAGE:v0.13.0`:

```
apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: KnativeEventing
metadata:
  name: knative-eventing
  namespace: knative-eventing
spec:
  registry:
    override:
      eventing-controller/eventing-controller: docker.io/knative-images-repo1/eventing-controller:v0.13.0
      eventing-webhook/eventing-webhook: docker.io/knative-images-repo2/eventing-webhook:v0.13.0
      imc-controller/controller: docker.io/knative-images-repo3/imc-controller:v0.13.0
      imc-dispatcher/dispatcher: docker.io/knative-images-repo4/imc-dispatcher:v0.13.0
      broker-controller/eventing-controller: docker.io/knative-images-repo5/broker-eventing-controller:v0.13.0
      DISPATCHER_IMAGE: docker.io/knative-images-repo5/DISPATCHER_IMAGE:v0.13.0
```

### Download images with secrets:

If your image repository requires private secrets for access, you must append the `imagePullSecrets` attribute.

This example uses a secret named `regcred`. Refer to [this guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod) to create your own private secrets.
After you create the secret, edit your operator CR by appending the content below:

```
apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: KnativeEventing
metadata:
  name: knative-eventing
  namespace: knative-eventing
spec:
  registry:
    ...
    imagePullSecrets:
      - name: regcred
```

The field `imagePullSecrets` expects a list of secrets. You can add multiple secrets to access the images as below:

```
apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: KnativeEventing
metadata:
  name: knative-eventing
  namespace: knative-eventing
spec:
  registry:
    ...
    imagePullSecrets:
      - name: regcred
      - name: regcred-2
      ...
```

## Configuring default broker class

Knative Eventing allows you to define a default broker class when the user does not specify one. The operator ships with two broker classes: `ChannelBasedBroker` and `MTChannelBasedBroker`. The field `defaultBrokerClass` indicates which class to use; if empty, the `ChannelBasedBroker` will be used.
Here is an example specifying `MTChannelBasedBroker` as the default:

```
apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: KnativeEventing
metadata:
  name: knative-eventing
  namespace: knative-eventing
spec:
  defaultBrokerClass: MTChannelBasedBroker
```
