# Install the Knative quickstart plugin

This quickstart plugin provides a simplified Knative installation on a kind or Minikube Kubernetes cluster running locally on a single computer. This installation is well suited for experimentation.

This installation requires the following prerequisites:

- The [CLI Tools](../client/install-kn.md) are installed.
- Sufficient hardware:

  6 CPUs, 6 GB of memory, and 30 GB of disk storage.

For information on production installs, see the [Installation Roadmap](README.md#installation-roadmap).
