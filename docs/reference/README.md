# Knative API Reference documentation

## View the latest release

The reference documentation for the latest release of the Knative is available
at [**www.knative.dev**](https://www.knative.dev/docs/reference/).

### Source files

The API source files are located at:

- [Serving API](./serving.md)
- [Build API](./build.md)
- [Eventing API](./eventing/eventing.md)
- [Eventing-contrib resources API](./eventing/eventing-resources.md)

## Updating API Reference docs (for Knative maintainers)

The Knative API reference documentation is manually generated using the
[`gen-api-reference-docs.sh`](../../hack/) tool. If you need to generate a new
version of the API docs for a recent update or for a new release, you can use
the following steps.

To learn more about the tool, see the
[gen-crd-api-reference-docs](https://github.com/ahmetb/gen-crd-api-reference-docs)
reference page.

### Before you begin

You must meet the following requirements to run the `gen-api-reference-docs.sh`
tool:

- You need the following software installed:
  - [`git`](https://git-scm.com/download/)
  - [`go` version 1.11+](https://golang.org/dl/)
- Clone [knative/docs](https://github.com/knative/docs) locally. For example:
  `git clone git@github.com:knative/docs.git`

### Generating the API

To generate a version of the API:

1. Ensure that your `GOPATH` is empty. The `gen-api-reference-docs.sh` script
   will result in the `GOPATH should not be set` error if your `GOPATH` is
   configured. You view the value by running the following command:

   ```
   echo $GOPATH
   ```

   If your `GOPATH` is already configured, temporarily clear the `GOPATH` value
   by running the following command:

   ```
   export GOPATH=""
   ```

1. Locate the commits or tags that correspond to the version of the API that you
   want to generate:

   - [Build](https://github.com/knative/build/releases/)
   - [Eventing](https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases/)
   - [Eventing-contrib resources](https://github.com/knative/eventing-contrib/releases/)
   - [Serving](https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/)

1. To run the `gen-api-reference-docs.sh` command from the `hack` directory, you
   specify the commits or tags for each of the corresponding Knative component
   variables (`KNATIVE_[component_name]_COMMIT`):

   ```
   KNATIVE_BUILD_COMMIT=[commit_or_tag] \
   KNATIVE_EVENTING_COMMIT=[commit_or_tag] \
   KNATIVE_EVENTING_SOURCES_COMMIT=[commit_or_tag] \
   KNATIVE_SERVING_COMMIT=[commit_or_tag] \
   ./gen-api-reference-docs.sh
   ```

   where `[commit_or_tag]` is the commit or tag in the specific repo that
   represents the version of the API that you want to generate. Also see the
   [example](#example) below.

   **Result**

   The `gen-api-reference-docs.sh` tool generates the API in a `tmp` folder.
   After a successful build, the tool automatically opens that folder in the
   `tmp` directory.

1. Copy the generated API files into the `docs/reference` directory of your
   knative/docs clone.

1. IMPORTANT: There are some limitations to the build script that require
   manual changes to the HTML. For the `serving.md` and
   `eventing-contrib-resources.md`, you must manually fix the `Packages` lists.
   Details for the required manual changes are in
   [PR 1552](https://github.com/knative/docs/pull/1552#issuecomment-506891983).

You can now perform the necessary steps to open a PR, complete a review, and
merge the new API files into the appropriate branch of the `knative/docs` repo.
See the [contributor flow](../../contributing/DOCS-CONTRIBUTING.md) for details
about requesting changes in the `knative/docs` repo.

### Example

To build a set of Knative API docs for v0.3, you can use the `v0.3.0` the tags
from each of the Knative component repositories, like
[Serving v0.3.0](https://github.com/knative/serving/tree/v0.3.0). If you want to
use a commit for Serving v0.3.0, you would use
[4d198d](https://github.com/knative/serving/commit/4d198db8756db2f8a3c228302a97fb3a216a9475).

Using tags from each repo, you would run the following command to generate the
v0.3.0 API source files:

```
KNATIVE_BUILD_COMMIT=v0.3.0 \
KNATIVE_EVENTING_COMMIT=v0.3.0 \
KNATIVE_EVENTING_SOURCES_COMMIT=v0.3.0 \
KNATIVE_SERVING_COMMIT=v0.3.0 \
./gen-api-reference-docs.sh
```
