# Knative code samples

You can use Knative code samples to help you get up and running with common use
cases.

## Knative owned samples

Knative code samples that are actively tested and maintained by Knative working groups:

- [Eventing and Eventing Sources code samples](eventing.md)
- [Serving code samples](serving.md)

## Community owned samples

Get up and running with one of the community code samples. These samples are
contributed and maintained by members of the Knative community. [View code samples that are contributed and maintained by the community](https://github.com/knative/docs/tree/main/code-samples/community).

**Note:** These samples might become outdated or the original author might be unable to maintain their contribution. If you find that something isn't working, lend a helping hand and fix it in a PR.
