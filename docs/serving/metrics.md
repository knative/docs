# Metrics API

<br>

**NOTE:** The metrics API may change in the future, this serves as a snapshot of the current metrics.
<br>

## Admin

Administrators can monitor Serving control plane based on the metrics exposed by each Serving component.
Metrics are listed next.

### Activator

The following metrics allow the user to understand how application responds when traffic goes through the activator eg. scaling from zero. For example high request latency means that requests are taken too much time be fulfilled.
<br>
| Metric Name | Description | Type | Tags | Unit | Status |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| request_concurrency | Concurrent requests that are routed to Activator<br>These are requests reported by the concurrency reporter which may not be done yet.<br> This is the average concurrency over a reporting period | Gauge | configuration_name<br>container_name<br>namespace_name<br>pod_name<br>revision_name<br>service_name | Dimensionless | Stable |
| request_count | The number of requests that are routed to Activator.<br>These are requests that have been fulfilled from the activator handler. | Counter | configuration_name<br>container_name<br>namespace_name<br>pod_name<br>response_code<br>response_code_class<br>revision_name<br>service_name | Dimensionless | Stable |
| request_latencies | The response time in millisecond for the fulfilled routed requests | Histogram | configuration_name<br>container_name<br>namespace_name<br>pod_name<br>response_code<br>response_code_class<br>revision_name<br>service_name | Milliseconds | Stable |

### Autoscaler

Autoscaler component exposes a number of metrics related to its decisions per revision.
For example at any given time user can monitor the desired pods the Autoscaler wants to allocate for
a service, the average number of requests per second during the stable window, whether autoscaler is in panic mode (KPA) etc.
To read more about how autoscaler works check [here](https://github.com/knative/serving/blob/main/docs/scaling/SYSTEM.md).

### Controller

The following metrics are emitted by any component that implements a controller logic.
The metrics show details about the reconciliation operations and the workqueue behavior on which
reconciliation requests are enqueued.

### Webhook

Webhook metrics report useful info about operations eg. CREATE on Serving resources and if admission was allowed.
For example if a big number of operations fail this could be an issue with the submitted user resource.

| Metric Name | Description | Type | Tags | Unit | Status |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| request_count | The number of requests that are routed to webhook | Counter |  admission_allowed<br>kind_group<br>kind_kind<br>kind_version<br>request_operation<br>resource_group<br>resource_namespace<br>resource_resource<br>resource_version | Dimensionless | Stable |

### Go Runtime - memstats

Each Knative Serving control plane process emits a number of Go runtime [memory statistics](https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#MemStats) (shown next).
As a baseline for monitoring purproses, user could start with a subset of the metrics: current allocations (go_alloc), total allocations (go_total_alloc), system memory (go_sys), mallocs (go_mallocs), frees (go_frees) and garbage collection total pause time (total_gc_pause_ns), next gc target heap size (go_next_gc) and number of garbage collection cycles (num_gc).

## Developer - User Services

Every Knative service has a proxy container that proxies the connections to the application container.
A number of metrics are reported for the queue peroxy performance. Using the following metrics application
developers, devops and others, could measure if requests are queued at the proxy side (need for backpressure) and what is the actual delay in serving requests at the application side.
