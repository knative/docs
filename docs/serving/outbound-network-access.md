This guides walks you through enabling outbound network access for a Knative
app.

Knative blocks all outbound traffic by default. To enable outbound access (when
you want to connect to the Cloud Storage API, for example), you need to change
the scope of the proxy IP range by editing the `config-network` map.

## Determining the IP scope of your cluster

To set the correct scope, you need to determine the IP ranges of your cluster.
The scope varies depending on your platform:

- For Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) run the following command to determine the
  scope. Make sure to replace the variables or export these values first.

  ```shell
  gcloud container clusters describe ${CLUSTER_NAME} \
    --zone=${CLUSTER_ZONE} | grep -e clusterIpv4Cidr -e servicesIpv4Cidr
  ```

- For IBM Cloud Private run the following command:

  ```shell
  cat cluster/config.yaml | grep service_cluster_ip_range
  ```

- For IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service use
  `172.30.0.0/16,172.20.0.0/16,10.10.10.0/24`
- For Azure Container Service (ACS) use `10.244.0.0/16,10.240.0.0/16`
- For Pivotal Container Service (PKS) on GCP use `10.200.0.0/16,10.100.200.0/24`
- For Minikube use `10.0.0.1/24`

## Setting the IP scope

The `istio.sidecar.includeOutboundIPRanges` parameter in the `config-network`
map specifies the IP ranges that Istio sidecar intercepts. To allow outbound
access, replace the default parameter value with the IP ranges of your cluster.

Run the following command to edit the `config-network` map:

```shell
kubectl edit configmap config-network --namespace knative-serving
```

Then, use an editor of your choice to change the
`istio.sidecar.includeOutboundIPRanges` parameter value from `*` to the IP range
you need. Separate multiple IP entries with a comma. For example:

```
# Please edit the object below. Lines beginning with a '#' will be ignored,
# and an empty file will abort the edit. If an error occurs while saving this file will be
# reopened with the relevant failures.
#
apiVersion: v1
data:
  istio.sidecar.includeOutboundIPRanges: '10.16.0.0/14,10.19.240.0/20'
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  ...
```

By default, the `istio.sidecar.includeOutboundIPRanges` parameter is set to `*`,
which means that Istio intercepts all traffic within the cluster as well as all
traffic that is going outside the cluster. Istio blocks all traffic that is
going outside the cluster unless you create the necessary egress rules.

When you set the parameter to a valid set of IP address ranges, Istio will no
longer intercept traffic that is going to the IP addresses outside the provided
ranges, and you don't need to specify any egress rules.

If you omit the parameter or set it to `''`, Knative uses the value of the
`global.proxy.includeIPRanges` parameter that is provided at Istio deployment
time. In the default Knative Serving deployment, `global.proxy.includeIPRanges`
value is set to `*`.

If an invalid value is passed, `''` is used instead.

If you are still having trouble making off-cluster calls, you can verify that
the policy was applied to the pod running your service by checking the metadata
on the pod. Verify that the `traffic.sidecar.istio.io/includeOutboundIPRanges`
annotation matches the expected value from the config-map.

```shell
$ kubectl get pod ${POD_NAME} --output yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  annotations:
    serving.knative.dev/configurationGeneration: "2"
    sidecar.istio.io/inject: "true"
    ...
    traffic.sidecar.istio.io/includeOutboundIPRanges: 10.16.0.0/14,10.19.240.0/20
...
```
