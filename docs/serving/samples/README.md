| Traffic Splitting          | This samples builds off the [Creating a RESTful Service](rest-api-go) sample to illustrate applying a revision, then using that revision for manual traffic splitting.                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                               [YAML](traffic-splitting/)                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
