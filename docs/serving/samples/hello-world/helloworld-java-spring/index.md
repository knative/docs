# Hello World - Spring Boot Java

This guide describes the steps required to create the `helloworld-java-spring` sample app and deploy it to your cluster.

The sample app reads a `TARGET` environment variable, and prints `Hello ${TARGET}!`. If `TARGET` is not specified, `World` is used as the default value.

You can also download a working copy of the sample, by running the following commands:

```shell
git clone -b "{{ branch }}" https://github.com/knative/docs knative-docs
cd knative-docs/docs/serving/samples/hello-world/helloworld-java-spring
```

## Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster with Knative installed and DNS configured. Follow the
  [installation instructions](../../../../install/README.md).
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed and running on your local machine,
  and a Docker Hub account configured.
- (optional) The Knative CLI client [kn](https://github.com/knative/client/releases) can be used to simplify the deployment. Alternatively, you can use `kubectl`, and apply resource files directly.

## Building the sample app

1. From the console, create a new, empty web project by using the curl and unzip
   commands:

   ```shell
   curl https://start.spring.io/starter.zip \
       -d dependencies=web \
       -d name=helloworld \
       -d artifactId=helloworld \
       -o helloworld.zip
   unzip helloworld.zip
   ```

   If you don't have `curl` installed, you can accomplish the same by visiting the
   [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) page. Specify Artifact as
   `helloworld` and add the `Web` dependency. Then click `Generate Project`,
   download and unzip the sample archive.

1. Update the `SpringBootApplication` class in
   `src/main/java/com/example/helloworld/HelloworldApplication.java` by adding a
   `@RestController` to handle the "/" mapping and also add a `@Value` field to
   provide the `TARGET` environment variable:

   ```java
   package com.example.helloworld;

   import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
   import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
   import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
   import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
   import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

   @SpringBootApplication
   public class HelloworldApplication {

     @Value("${TARGET:World}")
     String target;

     @RestController
     class HelloworldController {
       @GetMapping("/")
       String hello() {
         return "Hello " + target + "!";
       }
     }

     public static void main(String[] args) {
       SpringApplication.run(HelloworldApplication.class, args);
     }
   }
   ```

1. Run the application locally:

   ```shell
   ./mvnw package && java -jar target/helloworld-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

   Go to `http://localhost:8080/` to see your `Hello World!` message.

1. In your project directory, create a file named `Dockerfile` and copy the code block below into it:

   ```docker
   # Use the official maven/Java 8 image to create a build artifact.
   # https://hub.docker.com/_/maven
   FROM maven:3.5-jdk-8-alpine as builder

   # Copy local code to the container image.
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY pom.xml .
   COPY src ./src

   # Build a release artifact.
   RUN mvn package -DskipTests

   # Use AdoptOpenJDK for base image.
   # It's important to use OpenJDK 8u191 or above that has container support enabled.
   # https://hub.docker.com/r/adoptopenjdk/openjdk8
   # https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/#use-multi-stage-builds
   FROM adoptopenjdk/openjdk8:jdk8u202-b08-alpine-slim

   # Copy the jar to the production image from the builder stage.
   COPY --from=builder /app/target/helloworld-*.jar /helloworld.jar

   # Run the web service on container startup.
   CMD ["java", "-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom", "-jar", "/helloworld.jar"]
   ```
For detailed instructions on dockerizing a Spring Boot app, see [Spring Boot with Docker](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot-docker/).

For additional information on multi-stage docker builds for Java see [Creating Smaller Java Image using Docker Multi-stage Build](http://blog.arungupta.me/smaller-java-image-docker-multi-stage-build/).

**NOTE:** Use Docker to build the sample code into a container. To build and push with Docker Hub, run these commands replacing `{username}` with your Docker Hub username.

1. Use Docker to build the sample code into a container, then push the container to the Docker registry:

   ```shell
   # Build the container on your local machine
   docker build -t {username}/helloworld-java-spring .

   # Push the container to docker registry
   docker push {username}/helloworld-java-spring
   ```
## Deploying the app

After the build has completed and the container is pushed to Docker Hub, you can deploy the app into your cluster.

   
=== "yaml"

       1. Create a new file, `service.yaml` and copy the following service definition
          into the file. Make sure to replace `{username}` with your Docker Hub
          username.

          ```yaml
          apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
          kind: Service
          metadata:
            name: helloworld-java-spring
            namespace: default
          spec:
            template:
              spec:
                containers:
                  - image: docker.io/{username}/helloworld-java-spring
                    env:
                      - name: TARGET
                        value: "Java Spring Sample v1"
          ```

       Ensure that the container image value
       in `service.yaml` matches the container you built in the previous step. Apply
       the configuration using `kubectl`:

       ```shell
       kubectl apply --filename service.yaml
       ```


=== "kn"

       With `kn` you can deploy the service with

       ```shell
       kn service create helloworld-java-spring --image=docker.io/{username}/helloworld-java-spring --env TARGET="Java Spring Sample v1"
       ```

       This will wait until your service is deployed and ready, and ultimately it will print the URL through which you can access the service.





   During the creation of your service, Knative performs the following steps:

   - Create a new immutable revision for this version of the app.
   - Network programming to create a route, ingress, service, and load balance
     for your app.
   - Automatically scale your pods up and down, including scaling down to zero active pods.

## Verification

1. Find the domain URL for your service:

   
=== "kubectl"
       ```shell
       kubectl get ksvc helloworld-java-spring  --output=custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,URL:.status.url
       ```

       Example:

       ```shell
       NAME                      URL
       helloworld-java-spring    http://helloworld-java-spring.default.1.2.3.4.xip.io
       ```


=== "kn"

       ```shell
       kn service describe helloworld-java-spring -o url
       ```

       Example:

       ```shell
       http://helloworld-java-spring.default.1.2.3.4.xip.io
       ```




1. Make a request to your app and observe the result. Replace
   the URL below with the URL returned in the previous command.

   Example:

   ```shell
   curl http://helloworld-java-spring.default.1.2.3.4.xip.io
   Hello Java Spring Sample v1!

   # Even easier with kn:
   curl $(kn service describe helloworld-java-spring -o url)
   ```

   > Note: Add `-v` option to get more detail if the `curl` command failed.

## Deleting the app

To remove the sample app from your cluster, delete the service.


=== "kubectl"
    ```shell
    kubectl delete --filename service.yaml
    ```

=== "kn"
    ```shell
    kn service delete helloworld-java-spring
    ```
