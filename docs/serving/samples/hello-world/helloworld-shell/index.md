This guide describes the steps required to create the `helloworld-shell` sample app and deploy it to your
cluster.

The sample app reads a `TARGET` environment variable, and prints `Hello ${TARGET}!`.
If `TARGET` is not specified, `World` is used as the default value.

You can also download a working copy of the sample, by running the
following commands:

```shell
git clone -b "{{< branch >}}" https://github.com/knative/docs knative-docs
cd knative-docs/docs/serving/samples/hello-world/helloworld-shell
```

## Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster with Knative installed and DNS configured. Follow the
  [installation instructions](../../../../install/README.md).
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed and running on your local machine,
  and a Docker Hub account configured.
- Optional: You can use the Knative CLI client [`kn`](https://github.com/knative/client/releases) to simplify resource creation and deployment. Alternatively, you can use `kubectl` to apply resource files directly.

## Building

1. Create a new file named `script.sh` and paste the script below. This will run netcat (`nc`) in an endless loop, returning a friendly welcome message.

  ```shell
  #!/bin/sh
  while true ; do
    echo -e "HTTP/1.1 200\n\n Hello ${TARGET:=World}!\n" | nc -l -p 8080 -q 1;
  done
  ```

1. Create a new file named `Dockerfile` and copy the code block below into it.

   ```docker
   # Use the official Alpine image for a lean production container.
   # https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine
   FROM alpine:3

   # Update & install netcat (nc)
   RUN apk update \
    && apk add netcat-openbsd

   # Copy over the service script
   COPY script.sh /

   # Start up the webserver
   CMD [ "/bin/sh", "/script.sh" ]
   ```

Once you have recreated the sample code files (or used the files in the sample
folder) you're ready to build and deploy the sample app.

1. Use Docker to build the sample code into a container. To build and push with
   Docker Hub, run these commands replacing `{username}` with your Docker Hub
   username:

   ```shell
   # Build the container on your local machine
   docker build -t {username}/helloworld-shell .

   # Push the container to docker registry
   docker push {username}/helloworld-shell
   ```

## Deploying

1. After the build has completed and the container is pushed to Docker Hub, you
   can deploy the app into your cluster.

   {{< tabs name="helloworld_shell" default="kn" >}}
   {{% tab name="yaml" %}}

   1. Create a new file, `service.yaml` and copy the following service definition
      into the file. Make sure to replace `{username}` with your Docker Hub
      username.

      ```yaml
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      metadata:
        name: helloworld-shell
        namespace: default
      spec:
        template:
          spec:
            containers:
              - image: docker.io/{username}/helloworld-shell
                env:
                  - name: TARGET
                    value: "Shell Sample v1"
      ```

   Ensure that the container image value
   in `service.yaml` matches the container you built in the previous step. Apply
   the configuration using `kubectl`:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply --filename service.yaml
   ```

   {{< /tab >}}
   {{% tab name="kn" %}}

   With `kn` you can deploy the service with

   ```shell
   kn service create helloworld-shell --image=docker.io/{username}/helloworld-shell --env TARGET="Shell Sample v1"
   ```

   This will wait until your service is deployed and ready, and ultimately it will print the URL through which you can access the service.

   The output will look like:

   ```
   Creating service 'helloworld-shell' in namespace 'default':

    0.035s The Configuration is still working to reflect the latest desired specification.
    0.139s The Route is still working to reflect the latest desired specification.
    0.250s Configuration "helloworld-shell" is waiting for a Revision to become ready.
    8.040s ...
    8.136s Ingress has not yet been reconciled.
    8.277s unsuccessfully observed a new generation
    8.398s Ready to serve.

  Service 'helloworld-shell' created to latest revision 'helloworld-shell-kwdpt-1' is available at URL:
  http://helloworld-shell.default.1.2.3.4.xip.io
  ```

   {{< /tab >}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

   During the creation of your service, Knative performs the following steps:

   - Creates of a new immutable revision for this version of the app.
   - Programs the network to create a route, ingress, service, and load balance
     for your app.
   - Automatically scales your pods up and down (including to zero active pods).

## Verification

1. Run one of the followings commands to find the domain URL for your service.

   {{< tabs name="service_url" default="kn" >}}
   {{% tab name="kubectl" %}}
   ```shell
   kubectl get ksvc helloworld-shell  --output=custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,URL:.status.url
   ```

   Example:

   ```shell
   NAME                URL
   helloworld-shell    http://helloworld-shell.default.1.2.3.4.xip.io
   ```

   {{< /tab >}}
   {{% tab name="kn" %}}

   ```shell
   kn service describe helloworld-shell -o url
   ```

   Example:

   ```shell
   http://helloworld-shell.default.1.2.3.4.xip.io
   ```
   {{< /tab >}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

1. Now you can make a request to your app and see the result. Replace
   the URL below with the URL returned in the previous command.

   Example:

   ```shell
   curl http://helloworld-shell.default.1.2.3.4.xip.io
   Hello Shell Sample v1!

   # Even easier with kn:
   curl $(kn service describe helloworld-shell -o url)
   ```

   > Note: Add `-v` option to get more details if the `curl` command failed.

## Removing

To remove the sample app from your cluster, delete the service record.

{{< tabs name="service_url" default="kn" >}}
{{% tab name="kubectl" %}}
```shell
kubectl delete --filename service.yaml
```
{{< /tab >}}
{{% tab name="kn" %}}
```shell
kn service delete helloworld-shell
```
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}
