# Setting up a custom domain

By default, Knative Serving routes use `example.com` as the default domain. The
fully qualified domain name for a route by default is
`{route}.{namespace}.{default-domain}`.

To change the {default-domain} value there are a few steps involved:

## Edit using kubectl

1. Edit the domain configuration config-map to replace `example.com` with your
   own domain, for example `mydomain.com`:

     ```bash
     kubectl edit configmap config-domain -n knative-serving
     ```

     This command opens your default text editor and allows you to edit the [ConfigMap](https://github.com/knative/serving/blob/main/config/core/configmaps/domain.yaml).

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     data:
       _example: |
         ################################
         #                              #
         #    EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION     #
         #                              #
         ################################
         # ...
         example.com: |
     kind: ConfigMap
     ```

1. Edit the file to replace `example.com` with the domain you want to use, then remove the `_example` key and save your changes. In this example, `mydomain.com` is configured as the domain for all routes:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     data:
       mydomain.com: ""
     kind: ConfigMap
     [...]
     ```

## Apply from a file

You can also apply an updated domain configuration:

1. Replace the `example.org` and `example.com` values with the new domain you want to use and run the command:

     ```yaml
     kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: ConfigMap
     metadata:
       name: config-domain
       namespace: knative-serving
     data:
       # These are example settings of domain.
       # example.org will be used for routes having app=prod.
       example.org: |
         selector:
           app: prod
       # Default value for domain, for routes that does not have app=prod labels.
       # Although it will match all routes, it is the least-specific rule so it
       # will only be used if no other domain matches.
       example.com: ""
       EOF
     ```

## Deploy an application

> If you have an existing deployment, Knative reconciles the change made to the ConfigMap, and automatically updates the host name for all of the deployed Services and Routes.

Deploy an app (for example,
[`helloworld-go`](samples/hello-world/helloworld-go/)), to your
cluster as normal. You can retrieve the URL in Knative Route "helloworld-go"
with the following command:

```bash
kubectl get route helloworld-go --output jsonpath="{.status.url}"
```

You should see the full customized domain: `helloworld-go.default.mydomain.com`.

And you can check the IP address of your Knative gateway by running:

```bash
export INGRESSGATEWAY=istio-ingressgateway

if kubectl get configmap config-istio -n knative-serving &> /dev/null; then
    export INGRESSGATEWAY=istio-ingressgateway
fi

kubectl get svc $INGRESSGATEWAY --namespace istio-system --output jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[*]['ip']}"
```

## Local DNS setup

You can map the domain to the IP address of your Knative gateway in your local
machine with:

```bash
INGRESSGATEWAY=istio-ingressgateway

export GATEWAY_IP=`kubectl get svc $INGRESSGATEWAY --namespace istio-system --output jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[*]['ip']}"`

# helloworld-go is the generated Knative Route of "helloworld-go" sample.
# You need to replace it with your own Route in your project.
export DOMAIN_NAME=`kubectl get route helloworld-go --output jsonpath="{.status.url}" | cut -d'/' -f 3`

# Add the record of Gateway IP and domain name into file "/etc/hosts"
echo -e "$GATEWAY_IP\t$DOMAIN_NAME" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

```

You can now access your domain from the browser in your machine and do some
quick checks.

## Publish your Domain

Follow these steps to make your domain publicly accessible:

### Set static IP for Knative Gateway

You might want to
[set a static IP for your Knative gateway](gke-assigning-static-ip-address),
so that the gateway IP does not change each time your cluster is restarted.

### Update your DNS records

To publish your domain, you need to update your DNS provider to point to the IP
address for your service ingress.

- Create a [wildcard record](https://support.google.com/domains/answer/4633759)
  for the namespace and custom domain to the ingress IP Address, which would
  enable hostnames for multiple services in the same namespace to work without
  creating additional DNS entries.

  ```dns
  *.default.mydomain.com                   59     IN     A   35.237.28.44
  ```

- Create an A record to point from the fully qualified domain name to the IP
  address of your Knative gateway. This step needs to be done for each Knative
  Service or Route created.

  ```dns
  helloworld-go.default.mydomain.com        59     IN     A   35.237.28.44
  ```

If you are using Google Cloud DNS, you can find step-by-step instructions in the
[Cloud DNS quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/dns/quickstart).

Once the domain update has propagated, you can access your app using the fully
qualified domain name of the deployed route, for example
`http://helloworld-go.default.mydomain.com`
