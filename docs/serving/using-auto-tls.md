# Enabling automatic TLS certificate provisioning

If you install and configure cert-manager, you can configure Knative to
automatically obtain new TLS certificates and renew existing ones for Knative
Services.
To learn more about using secure connections in Knative, see
[Configuring HTTPS with TLS certificates](./using-a-tls-cert.md).

## Automatic TLS provision mode

Knative supports the following Auto TLS modes:

1.  Using DNS-01 challenge

    In this mode, your cluster needs to be able to talk to your DNS server to verify the ownership of your domain.
    - **Provision Certificate per namespace is supported when using DNS-01 challenge mode.**
      - This is the recommended mode for faster certificate provision.
      - In this mode, a single Certificate will be provisioned per namespace and is reused across the Knative Services within the same namespace.

    - **Provision Certificate per Knative Service is supported when using DNS-01 challenge mode.**
      - This is the recommended mode for better certificate islation between Knative Services.
      - In this mode, a Certificate will be provisioned for each Knative Service.
      - The TLS effective time is longer as it needs Certificate provision for each Knative Service creation.

1.  Using HTTP-01 challenge

    - In this type, your cluster does not need to be able to talk to your DNS server. You must map your domain to the IP of the cluser ingress.
    - When using HTTP-01 challenge, **a certificate will be provisioned per Knative Service.**
    - **HTTP-01 does not support provisioning a certificate per namespace.**

## Before you begin

You must meet the following prerequisites to enable Auto TLS:

- The following must be installed on your Knative cluster:
  - [Knative Serving](../install/).
  - A Networking layer such as Kourier, Istio with SDS v1.3 or higher, Contour v1.1 or higher, or Gloo v0.18.16 or higher.
  See [Install a networking layer](../install/install-serving-with-yaml.md#install-a-networking-layer) or
  [Istio with SDS, version 1.3 or higher](../install/installing-istio.md#installing-istio-with-SDS-to-secure-the-ingress-gateway).<br>
    **Note:** Currently, [Ambassador](https://github.com/datawire/ambassador) is unsupported for use with Auto TLS.
- [cert-manager version `1.0.0` and higher](./installing-cert-manager.md).
- Your Knative cluster must be configured to use a
  [custom domain](./using-a-custom-domain.md).
- Your DNS provider must be setup and configured to your domain.
- If you want to use HTTP-01 challenge, you need to configure your custom
domain to map to the IP of ingress. You can achieve this by adding a DNS A record to map the domain to the IP according to the instructions of your DNS provider.

## Enabling Auto TLS

To enable support for Auto TLS in Knative:

### Create cert-manager ClusterIssuer

1.  Create and add the `ClusterIssuer` configuration file to your Knative cluster
to define who issues the TLS certificates, how requests are validated,
and which DNS provider validates those requests.

    #### ClusterIssuer for DNS-01 challenge

    Use the cert-manager reference to determine how to configure your
    `ClusterIssuer` file:
    - See the generic
      [`ClusterIssuer` example](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/#creating-a-basic-acme-issuer)
    - Also see the
      [`DNS01` example](https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/latest/tasks/acme/configuring-dns01/index.html)

      **Example**: Cloud DNS `ClusterIssuer` configuration file:

      The following `letsencrypt-issuer` named `ClusterIssuer` file is
      configured for the Let's Encrypt CA and Google Cloud DNS. Under `spec`,
      the Let's Encrypt account info, required `DNS-01` challenge type, and
      Cloud DNS provider info defined. For the complete Google Cloud DNS
      example, see
      [Configuring HTTPS with cert-manager and Google Cloud DNS](./using-cert-manager-on-gcp.md).

      ```shell
      apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1alpha2
      kind: ClusterIssuer
      metadata:
        name: letsencrypt-dns-issuer
      spec:
        acme:
          server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
          # This will register an issuer with LetsEncrypt.  Replace
          # with your admin email address.
          email: myemail@gmail.com
          privateKeySecretRef:
            # Set privateKeySecretRef to any unused secret name.
            name: letsencrypt-dns-issuer
          solvers:
          - dns01:
              clouddns:
                # Set this to your GCP project-id
                project: $PROJECT_ID
                # Set this to the secret that we publish our service account key
                # in the previous step.
                serviceAccountSecretRef:
                  name: cloud-dns-key
                  key: key.json
      ```

    ####  ClusterIssuer for HTTP-01 challenge

    Run the following command to apply the ClusterIssuer for HTT01 challenge:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1alpha2
    kind: ClusterIssuer
    metadata:
      name: letsencrypt-http01-issuer
    spec:
      acme:
        privateKeySecretRef:
          name: letsencrypt
        server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
        solvers:
        - http01:
           ingress:
             class: istio
    EOF
    ```

1.  Ensure that the ClusterIssuer is created successfully:

    ```shell
    kubectl get clusterissuer <cluster-issuer-name> --output yaml
    ```

    Result: The `Status.Conditions` should include `Ready=True`.

### DNS-01 challenge only: Configure your DNS provider

If you choose to use DNS-01 challenge, configure which DNS provider is used to
validate the DNS-01 challenge requests.

Instructions about configuring cert-manager, for all the supported DNS
providers, are provided in
[DNS01 challenge providers and configuration instructions](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/#supported-dns01-providers).

Example:

See how the Google Cloud DNS is defined as the provider:
[Configuring HTTPS with cert-manager and Google Cloud DNS](./using-cert-manager-on-gcp.md#creating-a-service-account-and-using-a-kubernetes-secret)


### Install networking-certmanager deployment

1.  Determine if `networking-certmanager` is already installed by running the
    following command:

    ```shell
    kubectl get deployment networking-certmanager -n knative-serving
    ```

1.  If `networking-certmanager` is not found, run the following command:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply --filename {{ artifact( repo="net-certmanager", file="release.yaml") }}
    ```

### Install networking-ns-cert component

If you choose to use the mode of provisioning certificate per namespace, you need to install `networking-ns-cert` components.

**IMPORTANT:** Provisioning a certificate per namespace only works with DNS-01
 challenge. This component cannot be used with HTTP-01 challenge.

1. Determine if `networking-ns-cert` deployment is already installed by
running the following command:

    ```shell
    kubectl get deployment networking-ns-cert -n knative-serving
    ```

1. If `networking-ns-cert` deployment is not found, run the following command:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply --filename {{ artifact( repo="serving", file="serving-nscert.yaml") }}
    ```

### Configure config-certmanager ConfigMap

Update your [`config-certmanager` ConfigMap](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-certmanager/blob/main/config/config.yaml)
in the `knative-serving` namespace to reference your new `ClusterIssuer`.

1.  Run the following command to edit your `config-certmanager` ConfigMap:

    ```shell
    kubectl edit configmap config-certmanager --namespace knative-serving
    ```

1.  Add the `issuerRef` within the `data` section:

    ```shell
    ...
    data:
    ...
      issuerRef: |
        kind: ClusterIssuer
        name: letsencrypt-issuer
    ```

    Example:

    ```shell
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: config-certmanager
      namespace: knative-serving
      labels:
        networking.knative.dev/certificate-provider: cert-manager
    data:
      issuerRef: |
        kind: ClusterIssuer
        name: letsencrypt-http01-issuer
    ```

    `issueRef` defines which `ClusterIssuer` will be used by Knative to issue
    certificates.

1.  Ensure that the file was updated successfully:

    ```shell
    kubectl get configmap config-certmanager --namespace knative-serving --output yaml
    ```

### Turn on Auto TLS

Update the
[`config-network` ConfigMap](https://github.com/knative/serving/blob/main/config/core/configmaps/network.yaml)
in the `knative-serving` namespace to enable `autoTLS`and specify how HTTP
requests are handled:

1.  Run the following command to edit your `config-network` ConfigMap:

    ```shell
    kubectl edit configmap config-network --namespace knative-serving
    ```

1.  Add the `autoTLS: Enabled` attribute under the `data` section:

    ```shell
    ...
    data:
    ...
      autoTLS: Enabled
    ...
    ```

    Example:

    ```shell
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: config-network
      namespace: knative-serving
    data:
       ...
       autoTLS: Enabled
       ...
    ```

1.  Configure how HTTP and HTTPS requests are handled in the
  [`httpProtocol`](https://github.com/knative/serving/blob/main/config/core/configmaps/network.yaml#L109)
  attribute.

    By default, Knative ingress is configured to serve HTTP traffic
    (`httpProtocol: Enabled`). Now that your cluster is configured to use TLS
    certificates and handle HTTPS traffic, you can specify whether or not any
    HTTP traffic is allowed.

    Supported `httpProtocol` values:

    - `Enabled`: Serve HTTP traffic.
    - `Disabled`: Rejects all HTTP traffic.
    - `Redirected`: Responds to HTTP request with a `302` redirect to ask the
      clients to use HTTPS.

     ```shell
     ...
     data:
     ...
       autoTLS: Enabled
     ...
     ```

     Example:

     ```shell
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: ConfigMap
     metadata:
       name: config-network
       namespace: knative-serving
     data:
       ...
       autoTLS: Enabled
       ...
       httpProtocol: Redirected
       ...
     ```

    **Note:**
    When using HTTP-01 challenge, `httpProtocol` field has to be set to `Enabled` to make sure HTTP-01 challenge requests can be accepted by the cluster.

1.  Ensure that the file was updated successfully:

    ```shell
    kubectl get configmap config-network --namespace knative-serving --output yaml
    ```

Congratulations! Knative is now configured to obtain and renew TLS certificates.
When your TLS certificate is active on your cluster, your Knative services will
be able to handle HTTPS traffic.

### Verify Auto TLS

1.  Run the following comand to create a Knative Service:
    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knative/docs/main/docs/serving/autoscaling/autoscale-go/service.yaml
    ```

1.  When the certificate is provisioned (which could take up to several minutes depending on
    the challenge type), you should see something like:
    ```
    NAME               URL                                           LATESTCREATED            LATESTREADY              READY   REASON
    autoscale-go       https://autoscale-go.default.{custom-domain}   autoscale-go-6jf85 autoscale-go-6jf85       True  
    ```

    Note that the URL will be **https** in this case.

### Disable Auto TLS per service or route

If you have Auto TLS enabled in your cluster, you can choose to disable Auto TLS for individual services or routes by adding the annotation `networking.knative.dev/disableAutoTLS: true`.

Using the previous `autoscale-go` example:

1. Edit the service using `kubectl edit service.serving.knative.dev/autoscale-go -n default` and add the annotation:
```yaml
 apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
 kind: Service
 metadata:
   annotations:
    ...
     networking.knative.dev/disableAutoTLS: "true"
    ...
```
2. The service URL should now be **http**, indicating that AutoTLS is disabled:
```
NAME           URL                                          LATEST               AGE     CONDITIONS   READY   REASON
autoscale-go   http://autoscale-go.default.1.arenault.dev   autoscale-go-dd42t   8m17s   3 OK / 3     True    
```
