These instructions assume you have already setup a Knative cluster and installed
cert-manager into your cluster. For more information, see
[using an SSL certificate](using-an-ssl-cert.md#install-cert-manager). They also
assume you have already set up your managed zone with Cloud DNS as part of
configuring the domain to map to your IP address.

To automate the generation of a certificate with cert-manager and LetsEncrypt,
we will use a `DNS01` challenge type, which requires the domain owner to add a
TXT record to their zone to prove ownership. Other challenge types are not
currently supported by Knative.

## Creating a Cloud DNS service account

To add the TXT record, configure Knative with a service account that can be used
by cert-manager to create and update the DNS record.

To begin, create a new service account with the project role `dns.admin`:

```shell
# Set this to your GCP project ID
export PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>

# Name of the service account you want to create.
export CLOUD_DNS_SA=cert-manager-cloud-dns-admin
gcloud --project $PROJECT_ID iam service-accounts \
  create $CLOUD_DNS_SA \
  --display-name "Service Account to support ACME DNS-01 challenge."

# Fully-qualified service account name also has project-id information.
export CLOUD_DNS_SA=$CLOUD_DNS_SA@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com

# Bind the role dns.admin to this service account, so it can be used to support
# the ACME DNS01 challenge.
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
  --member serviceAccount:$CLOUD_DNS_SA \
  --role roles/dns.admin

# Download the secret key file for your service account.
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ~/key.json \
  --iam-account=$CLOUD_DNS_SA
```

After obtaining the service account secret, publish it to your cluster. This
command uses the secret name `cloud-dns-key`, but you can choose a different
name.

```shell
# Upload that as a secret in your Kubernetes cluster.
kubectl create secret --namespace cert-manager generic cloud-dns-key \
  --from-file=key.json=$HOME/key.json

# Delete the local secret
rm ~/key.json

```

## Configuring CertManager to use your DNS admin service account

Next, configure cert-manager to request new certificates and verify the
challenges using DNS.

### Specifying a certificate issuer

This example configures cert-manager to use LetsEncrypt, but you can use any
certificate provider that supports the ACME protocol.

This example uses the `dns01` challenge type, which will enable certificate
generation and wildcard certificates.

```shell
kubectl apply --filename - <<EOF
apiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-issuer
  namespace: cert-manager
spec:
  acme:
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    # This will register an issuer with LetsEncrypt.  Replace
    # with your admin email address.
    email: myemail@gmail.com
    privateKeySecretRef:
      # Set privateKeySecretRef to any unused secret name.
      name: letsencrypt-issuer
    dns01:
      providers:
      - name: cloud-dns-provider
        clouddns:
          # Set this to your GCP project-id
          project: $PROJECT_ID
          # Set this to the secret that we publish our service account key
          # in the previous step.
          serviceAccountSecretRef:
            name: cloud-dns-key
            key: key.json
EOF

```

To check if your ClusterIssuer is valid, enter:

```shell
kubectl get clusterissuer --namespace cert-manager letsencrypt-issuer --output yaml
```

Then confirm that its conditions have `Ready=True`. For example:

```yaml
status:
  acme:
    uri: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/acme/acct/40759665
  conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: 2018-08-23T01:44:54Z
      message: The ACME account was registered with the ACME server
      reason: ACMEAccountRegistered
      status: "True"
      type: Ready
```

### Specifying the certificate

Next, configure which certificate issuer to use and which secret you will
publish the certificate into. Use the Secret `istio-ingressgateway-certs`. The
following steps will overwrite this Secret if it already exists.

```shell
# Change this value to the domain you want to use.
export DOMAIN=your-domain.com

kubectl apply --filename - <<EOF
apiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: my-certificate
  # Istio certs secret lives in the istio-system namespace, and
  # a cert-manager Certificate is namespace-scoped.
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  # Reference to the Istio default cert secret.
  secretName: istio-ingressgateway-certs
  acme:
    config:
    # Each certificate could rely on different ACME challenge
    # solver.  In this example we are using one provider for all
    # the domains.
    - dns01:
        provider: cloud-dns-provider
      domains:
      # Since certificate wildcards only allow one level, we will
      # need to one for every namespace that Knative is used in.
      # We don't need to use wildcard here, fully-qualified domains
      # will work fine too.
      - "*.default.$DOMAIN"
      - "*.other-namespace.$DOMAIN"
  # The certificate common name, use one from your domains.
  commonName: "*.default.$DOMAIN"
  dnsNames:
  # Provide same list as `domains` section.
  - "*.default.$DOMAIN"
  - "*.other-namespace.$DOMAIN"
  # Reference to the ClusterIssuer we created in the previous step.
  issuerRef:
    kind: ClusterIssuer
    name: letsencrypt-issuer
EOF
```

To check that your certificate setting is valid, enter:

```shell
kubectl get certificate --namespace istio-system my-certificate --output yaml
```

Verify that its `Status.Conditions` have `Ready=True`. For example:

```yaml
status:
  acme:
    order:
      url: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/acme/order/40759665/45358362
  conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: 2018-08-23T02:28:44Z
      message: Certificate issued successfully
      reason: CertIssued
      status: "True"
      type: Ready
```

A condition with `Ready=False` is a failure to obtain certificate, and such
condition usually has an error message to indicate the reason of failure.

### Configuring the gateway

In the last step, configure the `knative-ingress-gateway` (or
`knative-shared-gateway` if using Knative Serving 0.2.x or prior version) to use
the certificate that is generated and stored automatically by cert-manager.

The key edit here is adding the `tls:` section to the end of the HTTPS port
configuration.

```shell
kubectl apply --filename - <<EOF
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: knative-ingress-gateway
  namespace: knative-serving
spec:
  selector:
    knative: ingressgateway
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 80
      name: http
      protocol: HTTP
    hosts:
    - "*"
  - port:
      number: 443
      name: https
      protocol: HTTPS
    hosts:
    - "*"
    tls:
      httpsRedirect: true # sends 301 redirect for http requests.
      mode: SIMPLE
      privateKey: /etc/istio/ingressgateway-certs/tls.key
      serverCertificate: /etc/istio/ingressgateway-certs/tls.crt
EOF
```

Now you can access your services via HTTPS; cert-manager will keep your
certificates up-to-date, replacing them before the certificate expires.
