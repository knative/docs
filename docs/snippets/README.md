# Snippets

This folder is for commonly used bits of information that need a single source of truth. Some examples include:
1. URLs that are frequently referenced and sometimes change
2. Code blocks that may be used in several locations
3. Topics that may need to be included in multiple places (e.g. "create a service")

For information on how to use Snippets, see [the pymdown-extension documentation](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/snippets/)
