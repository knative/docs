# Snippets

This folder is for commonly used bits of information that need a single source of truth. Some examples include:

1. Code blocks that may be used in several locations
2. Topics that may need to be included in multiple places (e.g. "create a service")
3. **Use your best judgement, wherever content needs to be re-used easily across the site**

For information on how to use Snippets, see [the pymdown-extension documentation](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/snippets/)
