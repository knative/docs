The Knative project provides a [Kubernetes Operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/). This Operator is used to install and manage [custom resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) that provide Knative features, such as Serving and Eventing, without the need to apply individual YAML files.
