<!-- Snippet used in the following topics:

-->
Building a function creates an OCI container image for your function that can be pushed to a container registry. It does not run or deploy the function, which can be useful if you want to build a container image for your function locally, but do not want to automatically run the function or deploy it to a cluster, for example, in a testing scenario.
