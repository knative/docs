The `deploy` command uses the function project name as the Knative Service name. When the function is built, the project name and the image registry name are used to construct a fully qualified image name for the function.

=== "func"

    Deploy the function by running the command inside the project directory:

    ```bash
    func deploy --registry <registry>
    ```

=== "kn func"

    Deploy the function by running the command inside the project directory:

    ```bash
    kn func deploy --registry <registry>
    ```

!!! Success "Expected output"
    ```{ .bash .no-copy }
        ðŸ™Œ Function image built: <registry>/hello:latest
        âœ… Function deployed in namespace "default" and exposed at URL:
        http://hello.default.127.0.0.1.sslip.io
    ```

You can verify that your function has been successfully deployed by using the `invoke` command and observing the output:

=== "func"

    ```bash
    func invoke
    ```

=== "kn func"

    ```bash
    kn func invoke
    ```

!!! Success "Expected output"
    ```{ .bash .no-copy }
