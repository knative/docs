# Administration overview

Knative has a comprehensive set of tools and capabilities to administer the serving and eventing of your container functions, apps, and microservices and for overall maintenance and optimization of your clusters and Kubernetes deployment.

Use the Installation Roadmap for guidance on installing Knative using the resources and tool choices that best fit your needs. You can install using YAML resources, manifests, or CLI tools that include the Knative operator.

The Knative operator is a custom controller that extends the Kubernetes API to install Knative components as well as configure your Kubernetes infrastructure accommodating tasks such as installing, deployment, scaling, updates, and recovery.

This documentation provides a set of administration topics for Serving and Eventing that provide guidance for application development and scaling, monitoring, networking, configuring resources, security, and troubleshooting.
