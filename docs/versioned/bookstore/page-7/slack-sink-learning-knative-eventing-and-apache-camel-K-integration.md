# **Slack sink - Learning Knative Eventing and the Apache Camel K integration**

![image](images/image2.png)

As a bookstore owner, you aim to receive instant notifications in a Slack channel whenever a customer submits a new review comment. By leveraging Knative Eventing and Apache Camel K, you can set up an event-driven service that automates these notifications, ensuring you're always informed.

## **What Knative features will we learn about?**

- Knative's ability to connect with third-party services, such as Slack, through event-driven integration using **Apache Camel K**.

## **What does the final deliverable look like?**

When a CloudEvent with the type `moderated-comment` and with `ce-bad-word-filter` set to `bad` is sent, it triggers a message to be sent in a designated Slack channel.

## **Install prerequisites**

### **Prerequisite 1: Install Apache Camel-Kamelets**

![image](images/image13.png)

Install Apache Camel K operator on your cluster using any of the methods listed in [the official installation docs](https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/2.8.x/installation/installation.html). We will use the installation via Kustomize:

```sh
kubectl create ns camel-k && \
kubectl apply -k github.com/apache/camel-k/install/overlays/kubernetes/descoped?ref=v2.8.0 --server-side
```

Now you need to setup an `IntegrationPlatform` with a container registry. You can read more about it in [the official installation docs](https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/2.8.x/installation/installation.html#integration-platform). For all our needs we only need to create the `IntegrationPlatform` CR with a container registry entry. For example let's say we're using a Kind cluster with a local registry named `kind-registry` on port `5000`. Then your `IntegrationPlatform` CR will look like the following:

```yaml
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: IntegrationPlatform
metadata:
  name: camel-k
  namespace: camel-k # Make sure this is the namespace where your operator is running
spec:
  build:
    registry:
      address: kind-registry:5000
      insecure: true
```

Install it with one command:

```sh
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: IntegrationPlatform
metadata:
  name: camel-k
  namespace: camel-k
spec:
  build:
    registry:
      address: kind-registry:5000
      insecure: true
EOF
```

If you are using other container registries, you may need to read more in the [container registry configuration docs](https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/2.8.x/installation/registry/registry.html#how-to-configure){:target="_blank"} for Apache Camel K.

???+ success "Verify"

    Check the installation status of the operator:

    ```sh
    kubectl get deploy -n camel-k
    ```

    You will see the output:

    ```
    NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    camel-k-operator   1/1     1            1           47h
    ```

    And the IntegrationPlatform:

    ```sh
    kubectl get integrationplatforms -n camel-k
    ```

    You will see the output with the registry address:

    ```sh
    kubectl get integrationplatforms -n camel-k
    NAME      PHASE   BUILD STRATEGY   PUBLISH STRATEGY   REGISTRY ADDRESS     DEFAULT RUNTIME   CAMEL VERSION
    camel-k   Ready   routine          Jib                kind-registry:5000   3.15.3            4.8.5
    ```

### **Prerequisite 2: Create a Slack App and Generate an Incoming Webhook URL**

![image](images/image21.png)

Follow the instructions [here](../create-slack-workspace/README.md){:target="_blank"} on how to create the Slack workspace and generate an incoming webhook URL for your designated channel where notifications will be sent to.

???+ success "Verify"

    You should have a webhook URL that looks like this:

    ```sh
    https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    ```

    Save this URL as you will need it later.

### **Prerequisite 3: Create a Secret that stores your Slack Credentials**

![image](images/image22.png)

We are storing the webhook URL as a secret. Copy and paste your webhook URL into the file `slack-sink/application.properties`

???+ abstract "_slack-sink/application.properties_"

    ```
    slack.channel=#bookstore-owner
    slack.webhook.url=https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    ```

Then run the following command from the `start` directory:

```sh
kubectl create secret generic slack-credentials --from-file=slack-sink/application.properties
```

???+ success "Verify"

    You should see this message if the secret is created successfully:

    ```sh
    secret/slack-credentials created
    ```

## **Implementation**

### **Step 0: Learn about Pipe**

![image](images/image14.png)

We use a feature called ["Pipe"](https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/2.8.x/apis/camel-k.html#_camel_apache_org_v1_Pipe){:target="_blank"} (a.k.a [KameletBinding](https://github.com/apache/camel-k/issues/2625){:target="_blank"}) in Apache Camel K to link event sources and destinations. Specifically, the Pipe connects events from our Broker, our source, to the Slack channel through a Slack sink [Kamelet](https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/2.8.x/apis/camel-k.html#_camel_apache_org_v1_Kamelet){:target="_blank"}, our destination.

![image](images/image10.png)

From the sample YAML below, you can see we are telling the pipe to filter on the events that have type "moderated-comment". Pipe will create a Trigger under the hood and route your event to slack-sink.

```yaml
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: Pipe
metadata:
  name: pipe
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Broker
      apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
      name: badword-broker
    properties:
      type: moderated-comment
  sink:
    ...
```

If you hope to learn more about it, check out the article [Event Sourcing with Apache Camel K and Knative Eventing by Matthias WeÃŸendorf](https://knative.dev/blog/articles/knative-meets-apache-camel){:target="_blank"}!

### **Step 1: Create the Broker that can route "bad word" comments to Slack**

![image](images/image19.png)

In the current implementation using Apache Camel K, we **can only filter based on the CloudEvent's type**, such as moderated-comment. Filtering based on event extensions, such as `badwordfilter: good`, is not yet supported. This feature will be available in a future update of Apache Camel K. But we can still use an alternative way to achieve this!

![image](images/image11.png)

Here, we will be connecting `bookstore-broker` with a new Broker called `badword-broker`. And we will be creating a Trigger that helps us perform the filtering with the extension `badwordfilter: good`.

- 1: Create a new file named `slack-sink/config/100-broker.yaml` and add the following content:

???+ abstract "_slack-sink/config/100-broker.yaml_"

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
    kind: Broker
    metadata:
      name: badword-broker
    ```

- 2: Apply the YAML file:

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f slack-sink/config/100-broker.yaml
    ```

You should see this message if the Broker is created successfully:

```
broker.eventing.knative.dev/badword-broker created
```

Alternatively, use the [Knative CLI `kn`](https://knative.dev/docs/client/#kn){:target="_blank"} to create the broker:

```sh
kn broker create badword-broker
```

You should see this message if the Broker is created successfully:

```
Broker 'badword-broker' successfully created in namespace 'default'.
```

???+ success "Verify"

    Run the following command to list the Brokers:
    ```sh
    kubectl get brokers
    ```

    You should see the `badword-broker` listed.
    ```
    NAME               URL                                                                                 AGE     READY   REASON
    badword-broker     http://broker-ingress.knative-eventing.svc.cluster.local/default/badword-broker     3s      True    
    bookstore-broker   http://broker-ingress.knative-eventing.svc.cluster.local/default/bookstore-broker   5h38m   True   
    ``` 


???+ bug "Troubleshooting"

    If there are issues, use the following command to diagnose:

    ```sh
    kubectl describe broker badword-broker
    ```

### **Step 2: Create Trigger that filters for bad word comments to badword-broker**

![image](images/image12.png)

We are creating the Trigger to process the events that have type `moderated-comment`, and the extension `badwordfilter: bad` and route them to `badword-broker`.

**Create a Trigger:**

![image](images/image17.png)

- 1: Append the following content to your `slack-sink/config/100-broker.yaml`:

???+ abstract "_slack-sink/config/100-broker.yaml_"

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
    kind: Trigger
    metadata:
      name: badword-noti-trigger
    spec:
      broker: bookstore-broker
      filter:
        attributes: # Trigger will filter events based on BOTH the type and badwordfilter attribute
          type: moderated-comment # This is the filter that will be applied to the event, only events with the ce-type moderated-comment will be processed
          badwordfilter: bad # This is the filter that will be applied to the event, only events with the ce-extension badwordfilter: bad will be processed
      subscriber:
        ref:
          apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
          kind: Broker
          name: badword-broker
    ```

- 2: Apply the YAML file:

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f slack-sink/config/100-broker.yaml
    ```

    You should see this message if the Trigger is created successfully:
      
    ```sh
    broker.eventing.knative.dev/badword-broker unchanged
    trigger.eventing.knative.dev/badword-noti-trigger created
    ```

???+ success "Verify"

    ```sh
    kubectl get triggers
    ```

    The Trigger `badword-noti-trigger` should have `READY` status as `True`.

    ```
    NAME                BROKER             SUBSCRIBER_URI                                                       AGE     READY   REASON
    db-insert-trigger   bookstore-broker   http://node-server-svc.default.svc.cluster.local/insert              5h41m   True    
    seq-reply-trigger   bookstore-broker   http://event-display.default.svc.cluster.local                       5h39m   True    
    sequence-trigger    bookstore-broker   http://sequence-kn-sequence-0-kn-channel.default.svc.cluster.local   5h39m   True    
    log-trigger         bookstore-broker   http://event-display.default.svc.cluster.local                       5h41m   True   
    badword-noti-triggerbookstore-broker   http://broker-ingress.knative-eventing.svc.cluster.local/default/badword-broker                       5h41m   True   
    ```

### **Step 3: Build the Pipe**

This setup automatically sends notifications to Slack whenever a new comment that contains "bad word" occur, streamlining the flow of information.

- 1: Make sure you have your k8s secret that contains your Slack webhook Url ready. If not, refer to the [Prerequisite 3](#prerequisite-3-create-a-slack-app-and-generate-an-incoming-webhook-url) section.

- 2: Prepare the YAML configuration for the Slack sink, which will forward events to your Slack channel:

![image](images/image15.png)

Create a new file named `slack-sink/config/100-slack-sink.yaml` and add the following content:

???+ abstract "_slack-sink/config/100-slack-sink.yaml_"

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
    kind: Pipe
    metadata:
      name: pipe
      annotations:
        trait.camel.apache.org/mount.configs: "secret:slack-credentials"
    spec:
      source:
        ref:
          kind: Broker
          apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
          name: badword-broker
        properties:
          type: moderated-comment
      sink:
        ref:
          kind: Kamelet
          apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
          name: slack-sink
        properties:
          channel: ${slack.channel}
          webhookUrl: ${slack.webhook.url}
    ```

3. Apply the configuration to your Kubernetes cluster:

```sh
kubectl apply -f slack-sink/config/100-slack-sink.yaml
```

???+ success "Verify"
      You will see this message if the configuration is created successfully:

      ```sh
      pipe.camel.apache.org/pipe created
      ```

      But this process will take a few seconds to complete. You can check the status of the pipe by running the following command:

      ```sh
      kubectl get pipe pipe
      ```

      ```sh
      NAME              PHASE     REPLICAS
      pipe              Ready     1
      ```

### **Step 4: Modify the Knative Services to disable scale to zero**

![image](images/image6.png)

In this step, we'll configure the notification delivery service to prevent it from [scaling down to zero](https://knative.dev/docs/serving/autoscaling/scale-to-zero/){:target="_blank"}, ensuring timely notifications.

!!! note
    `ksvc` stands for [Knative Service](https://knative.dev/docs/serving/services/){:target="_blank"}.

1. **Check Existing Knative Services:**

```sh
kubectl get ksvc
```

You should see a service named `pipe` listed:

```sh
NAME     URL                                         LATESTCREATED   LATESTREADY    READY   REASON
pipe     http://pipe.default.svc.cluster.local       pipe-00002      pipe-00002     True
```

2. **Edit the Knative Service:**

To prevent the notification service from scaling down to zero, set the minimum number of pods to keep running.

```sh
kubectl patch ksvc pipe --type merge -p '{"spec":{"template":{"metadata":{"annotations":{"autoscaling.knative.dev/min-scale":"1"}}}}}'
```

Or use the edit command:

```sh
kubectl edit ksvc pipe
```

Add the following annotation:

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        autoscaling.knative.dev/min-scale: "1"
```

This configuration ensures that Knative will always maintain at least one instance of the service running.

???+ success "Verify"

    ```sh
    kubectl get pods
    ```

    Periodically check the status of the pipe-deployment pods, and see whether they will disappear! If they stay there, then we are good!

### **Verification**

![image](images/image4.png)

Now, you have completed building the sample app. When you submit a "bad" comment, you should receive a notification in your test Slack workspace, achieving the same result as shown in the demo video.

## **Conclusion**

In this tutorial, you learned how to set up an event-driven service that automates notifications to a Slack channel using Knative Eventing and Apache Camel K. By leveraging these technologies, you can seamlessly connect your applications to third-party services and facilitate real-time information exchange between them.
