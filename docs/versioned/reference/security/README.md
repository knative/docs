# Knative Security and Disclosure Information

This page describes how to validate code and report security vulnerabilities in Knative.

For a complete description of the Knative threat model, see the following resource:

* [Knative Security Working Group repository-Threat Model](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/main/working-groups/security/threat-model.md)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We're extremely grateful for security researchers and users that report vulnerabilities to the Knative Open Source Community. All reports are thoroughly investigated by a set of community volunteers.

To make a report, please email the private [security@knative.team](mailto:security@knative.team) list with the security details and the details expected for all Knative bug reports.

### When Should I Report a Vulnerability?

* You think you discovered a potential security vulnerability in Knative
* You are unsure how a vulnerability affects Knative
* You think you discovered a vulnerability in another project that Knative depends on
    * For projects with their own vulnerability reporting and disclosure process, please report it directly there

### When Should I NOT Report a Vulnerability?

* You need help tuning Knative components for security
* You need help applying security related updates
* Your issue is not security related
