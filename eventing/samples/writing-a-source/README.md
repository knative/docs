This tutorial walks you through creating an event source for Knative Eventing
"the hard way", without using helper objects like ContainerSource.

After completing through this tutorial, you'll have a basic working event source
controller and dispatcher (TODO) based on the Kubebuilder framework.

Just want to see the code? The reference project is
https://github.com/grantr/sample-source.

## Target Audience

The target audience is already familiar with Kubernetes and Go development and
wants to develop a new event source for use with Knative Eventing.

## Before you begin

You'll need these tools installed:

*   git
*   golang
*   make
*   [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep)
*   [kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder)
*   [kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize)
*   [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
    (optional)
*   [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) (optional)

## Steps

1.   [Bootstrap Project](01-bootstrap.md)
1.  [Define The Source Resource](02-define-source.md)
1.  [Reconcile Sources](03-reconcile-sources.md)
1.  [Publish to Cluster](04-publish-to-cluster.md)
1.  Dispatching Events

## Alternatives

Kubebuilder not your thing? Prefer the easy way? Check out these alternatives.

*   [ContainerSource](https://github.com/knative/docs/tree/master/eventing/sources#meta-sources)
    is an easy way to turn any dispatcher container into an Event Source.
*   [Auto ContainerSource](https://github.com/knative/docs/tree/master/eventing/sources#meta-sources)
    is an even easier way to turn any dispatcher container into an Event Source
    without writing any controller code. It requires Metacontroller.
*   [Metacontroller](https://metacontroller.app) can be used to write
    controllers as webhooks in any language.
*   The [GitLab source](https://gitlab.com/triggermesh/gitlabsource) uses the
    Python Kubernetes client library.
*   The [Cloud Scheduler source](https://github.com/vaikas-google/csr) uses the
    standard Kubernetes Golang client library instead of Kubebuilder.
