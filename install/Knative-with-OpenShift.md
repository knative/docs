# Knative Install on OpenShift

This guide walks you through the installation of the latest version of [Knative
Serving](https://github.com/knative/serving) on [OpenShift](https://github.com/openshift/origin) by using the Knative Serving Operator. The operator is available on the OpenShift embedded Operatorhub. Create and deploy an image of a sample "hello world" app onto the newly created Knative cluster.

You can find [guides for other platforms here](README.md).

## Before you begin

* An OpenShift 4 cluster is required for installation. Visit [try.openshift.com](try.openshift.com) for information on setting up a cluster. You will need cluster administrator privileges to install and use Knative on an OpenShift cluster. 

> Note: Currently, long-running clusters are not supported on OpenShift 4.


## Installing the Knative Serving Operator

1. Go to **Catalog > OperatorHub** in the OpenShift Web Console. A list of operators for OpenShift, provided by Red Hat as well as a community of partners and open-source projects is provided. Click on the **Knative Serving Operator** tile.

> **NOTE:** Use the **Filter by Keyword** box to facilitate the search of the Knative Serving operator in the catalog.

2. A **Show Community Operator** dialog box will open. Click **Continue** to proceed.

3. The **Knative Serving Operator** descriptor screen will appear. Click **Install**.

4. On the **Create the Operator Subscription** screen, create a new subscription by clicking on the **Subscribe** button. This will install the Knative Serving Operator in the project `openshift-operators` and Knative Serving in the `knative-serving` project.

> **NOTE:** The Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) installs the operator, which will automatically install Knative. This installation will create the `knative-serving`, `istio-operator`, and `istio-system` namespaces.

5. Verify the subscription status for the installation operator, by viewing the **Subscription Overview**. The **UPGRADE STATUS** will update from **0 Installing** to **1 Installed**. 

> **NOTE:** The screen will update after a few minutes. Wait for the `knative-serving` namespace to appear in the project drop-down menu. Refresh the page if needed.

6. Knative Serving is now installed. Navigate to **Catalog > Installed Operators** to confirm the operator is installed. Click on **knative-serving** to view the install status.

## Deploying an app

Now that your cluster has Knative installed, you're ready to deploy an app.

If you'd like to follow a step-by-step guide for deploying your first app on
Knative, check out the
[Getting Started with Knative App Deployment](./getting-started-knative-app.md)
guide.

If you'd like to view the available sample apps and deploy one of your choosing,
head to the [sample apps](../serving/samples/README.md) repo.

> Note: When looking up the IP address to use for accessing your app, you need
> to look up the NodePort for the `istio-ingressgateway` well as the IP address
> used for OpenShift. You can use the following command to look up the value to
> use for the {IP_ADDRESS} placeholder used in the samples:

```shell
# In Knative 0.2.x and prior versions, the `knative-ingressgateway` service was used instead of `istio-ingressgateway`.
INGRESSGATEWAY=knative-ingressgateway

# The use of `knative-ingressgateway` is deprecated in Knative v0.3.x.
# Use `istio-ingressgateway` instead, since `knative-ingressgateway`
# will be removed in Knative v0.4.
if kubectl get configmap config-istio -n knative-serving &> /dev/null; then
    INGRESSGATEWAY=istio-ingressgateway
fi

export IP_ADDRESS=$(oc get node  -o 'jsonpath={.items[0].status.addresses[0].address}'):$(oc get svc $INGRESSGATEWAY -n istio-system -o 'jsonpath={.spec.ports[?(@.port==80)].nodePort}')
```

## Uninstalling the Knative Serving Operator

1. Go to **Catalog > OperatorHub** in the OpenShift Web Console.

2. Click on the **Knative Serving Operator** tile.

![KSO Uninstall Tile](images/knative_serving_uninstall_operator.png)

> **NOTE:** The operator tile will indicate it is installed.

3. The **Show Community Operator**` dialog box will appear. Click **Continue** to proceed.

4. Once the **Knative Serving Operator** descriptor screen appears, click **Uninstall**.

5. Select **Also completely remove the Operator from the selected namespace**, in the **Remove Operator Subscription** dialog box.

6. Click **Remove**.


## Cleaning up

Delete your test cluster by running:

```shell
oc cluster down
rm -rf openshift.local.clusterup
```
