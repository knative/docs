# Knative Install

To get started with Knative, you need a Kubernetes cluster. If you aren't
sure what Kubernetes platform is right for you, see
[Picking the Right Solution](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/pick-right-solution/).
We provide information for installing Knative on
[Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/) and
[Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/) clusters.

## Install guides

There are step-by-step guides for setting up Kubernetes and installing
Knative components on the following platforms:

* [Easy Install on Google Kubernetes Engine](Knative-with-GKE.md)
* [Easy Install on Minikube](Knative-with-Minikube.md)

## Deploying an app

Once you have Knative installed on your Kubernetes cluster, you're ready to
deploy an app.

You have two options:

* You can follow the step-by-step
  [Getting Started with Knative App Deployment](getting-started-knative-app.md)
  guide.

* You can view the available [sample apps](../serving/samples/README.md) and
