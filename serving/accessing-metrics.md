# Accessing metrics

You access metrics through the [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) UI. Grafana is
the visualization tool for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).

1. To open Grafana, enter the following command:
```
kubectl port-forward -n monitoring $(kubectl get pods -n monitoring --selector=app=grafana --output=jsonpath="{.items..metadata.name}") 3000
```

  * This starts a local proxy of Grafana on port 3000. For security reasons, the Grafana UI is exposed only within the cluster.

2. Navigate to the Grafana UI at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

3. Select the **Home** button on the top of the page to see the list of pre-installed dashboards (screenshot below):

  The following dashboards are pre-installed with Knative Serving:

  * **Revision HTTP Requests:** HTTP request count, latency, and size metrics per revision and per configuration
  * **Nodes:** CPU, memory, network, and disk metrics at node level
  * **Pods:** CPU, memory, and network metrics at pod level
  * **Deployment:** CPU, memory, and network metrics aggregated at deployment level
  * **Istio, Mixer and Pilot:** Detailed Istio mesh, Mixer, and Pilot metrics
  * **Kubernetes:** Dashboards giving insights into cluster health, deployments, and capacity usage  

4. Set up an administrator account to modify or add dashboards by signing in with username: `admin` and password: `admin`.  
  * Before you expose the Grafana UI outside the cluster, make sure to change the password.
