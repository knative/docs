# Monitoring, Logging and Tracing Installation

Knative Serving offers two different monitoring setups:
[Elasticsearch, Kibana, Prometheus and Grafana](#elasticsearch-kibana-prometheus--grafana-setup)
or
[Stackdriver, Prometheus and Grafana](#stackdriver-prometheus--grafana-setup)
You can install only one of these two setups and side-by-side installation of
these two are not supported.

## Before you begin

The following instructions assume that you cloned the Knative Serving repository.
To clone the repository, run the following commands:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/knative/serving knative-serving
   cd knative-serving
   git checkout v0.2.1
   ```

## Elasticsearch, Kibana, Prometheus & Grafana Setup

If you installed the
[full Knative release](../install/README.md#installing-knative),
the monitoring component is already installed and you can skip down to the
[Create Elasticsearch Indices](#create-elasticsearch-indices) section.

To configure and setup monitoring:

1. Choose a container image that meets the
   [Fluentd image requirements](fluentd/README.md#requirements). For example, you can use the
   public image [k8s.gcr.io/fluentd-elasticsearch:v2.0.4](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cluster/addons/fluentd-elasticsearch/fluentd-es-image).
   Or you can create a custom one and upload the image to a container registry
   which your cluster has read access to.
1. Follow the instructions in
   ["Setting up a logging plugin"](setting-up-a-logging-plugin.md#Configuring)
   to configure the Elasticsearch components settings.
1. Install Knative monitoring components by running the following command from the root directory of
   [knative/serving](https://github.com/knative/serving) repository:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply --recursive --filename config/monitoring/100-common \
      --filename config/monitoring/150-elasticsearch \
      --filename third_party/config/monitoring/common \
      --filename third_party/config/monitoring/elasticsearch \
      --filename config/monitoring/200-common \
      --filename config/monitoring/200-common/100-istio.yaml
   ```

   The installation is complete when logging & monitoring components are all
   reported `Running` or `Completed`:

     ```shell
     kubectl get pods --namespace monitoring --watch
     ```

     ```

     ```

    CTRL+C to exit watch.
  
1. Verify that each of your nodes have the `beta.kubernetes.io/fluentd-ds-ready=true` label:

   ```shell
   kubectl get nodes --selector beta.kubernetes.io/fluentd-ds-ready=true
   ```

1. If you receive the `No Resources Found` response:

     1. Run the following command to ensure that the Fluentd DaemonSet runs on all your nodes:
     
        ```shell
        kubectl label nodes --all beta.kubernetes.io/fluentd-ds-ready="true"
        ```

     1. Run the following command to ensure that the `fluentd-ds` daemonset is ready on at least one node:

        ```shell
        kubectl get daemonset fluentd-ds --namespace knative-monitoring
        ```

### Create Elasticsearch Indices

To visualize logs with Kibana, you need to set which Elasticsearch indices to explore. We will
create two indices in Elasticsearch using `Logstash` for application logs and `Zipkin`
for request traces.

- To open the Kibana UI (the visualization tool for [Elasticsearch](https://info.elastic.co)),
  you must start a local proxy by running the following command:

   ```shell
   kubectl proxy
   ```

  This command starts a local proxy of Kibana on port 8001. For security
  reasons, the Kibana UI is exposed only within the cluster.

- Navigate to the
  [Kibana UI](http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/knative-monitoring/services/kibana-logging/proxy/app/kibana).
  _It might take a couple of minutes for the proxy to work_.

- Within the "Configure an index pattern" page, enter `logstash-*` to
  `Index pattern` and select `@timestamp` from `Time Filter field name` and
  click on `Create` button.

![Create logstash-* index](images/kibana-landing-page-configure-index.png)

- To create the second index, select `Create Index Pattern` button on top left
  of the page. Enter `zipkin*` to `Index pattern` and select `timestamp_millis`
  from `Time Filter field name` and click on `Create` button.


## Stackdriver, Prometheus & Grafana Setup

You must configure and build your own Fluentd image if either of the following are true:

 * Your Knative Serving component is not hosted on a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) based cluster.
 * You want to send logs to another GCP project.

To configure and setup monitoring:

1. Choose a container image that meets the
   [Fluentd image requirements](fluentd/README.md#requirements). For example, you can use a
   public image. Or you can create a custom one and upload the image to a
   container registry which your cluster has read access to.
1. Follow the instructions in
   ["Setting up a logging plugin"](setting-up-a-logging-plugin.md#Configuring)
   to configure the stackdriver components settings.
1. Install Knative monitoring components by running the following command from the root directory of
   [knative/serving](https://github.com/knative/serving) repository:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply --recursive --filename config/monitoring/100-common \
     --filename config/monitoring/150-stackdriver \
     --filename third_party/config/monitoring/common \
     --filename config/monitoring/200-common \
     --filename config/monitoring/200-common/100-istio.yaml
   ```

     The installation is complete when logging & monitoring components are all
     reported `Running` or `Completed`:

    ```shell
    kubectl get pods --namespace monitoring --watch
    ```

    ```

    ```

    CTRL+C to exit watch.
