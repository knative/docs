# Monitoring, Logging and Tracing Installation

Knative Serving offers two different monitoring setups: 
One that uses Elasticsearch, Kibana, Prometheus and Grafana and 
another that uses Stackdriver, Prometheus and Grafana. See below 
for installation instructions for these two setups. You can install 
only one of these two setups and side-by-side installation of these two are not supported.

## Elasticsearch, Kibana, Prometheus & Grafana Setup

*If you installed Knative Serving using [Easy Install](../install/README.md#Installing-Knative) guide, 
skip this step and continue to [Create Elasticsearch Indices](#Create-Elasticsearch-Indices)*


Run:

```shell
kubectl apply -R -f config/monitoring/100-common \
    -f config/monitoring/150-elasticsearch \
    -f third_party/config/monitoring/common \
    -f third_party/config/monitoring/elasticsearch \
    -f config/monitoring/200-common \
    -f config/monitoring/200-common/100-istio.yaml
```

Monitor logging & monitoring components, until all of the components report Running or Completed:

```shell
kubectl get pods -n monitoring --watch
```

CTRL+C when it's done.

### Create Elasticsearch Indices
We will create two indexes in ElasticSearch - one for application logs and one for request traces. 
To create the indexes, open Kibana Index Management UI at this [link](http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/monitoring/services/kibana-logging/proxy/app/kibana#/management/kibana/index)
(*it might take a couple of minutes for the proxy to work the first time after the installation*).

Within the "Configure an index pattern" page, enter `logstash-*` to `Index pattern` and select `@timestamp` 
from `Time Filter field name` and click on `Create` button. See below for a screenshot:

![Create logstash-* index](images/kibana-landing-page-configure-index.png)

To create the second index, select `Create Index Pattern` button on top left of the page. 
Enter `zipkin*` to `Index pattern` and select `timestamp_millis` from `Time Filter field name` 
and click on `Create` button.

Next, visit instructions below to access to logs, metrics and traces:

* [Accessing Logs](./accessing-logs.md)
* [Accessing Metrics](./accessing-metrics.md)
* [Accessing Traces](./accessing-traces.md)

## Stackdriver(logs), Prometheus & Grafana Setup

If your Knative Serving is not built on a GCP based cluster or you want to send logs to
another GCP project, you need to build your own Fluentd image and modify the
configuration first. See

1. [Fluentd image on Knative Serving](/image/fluentd/README.md)
2. [Setting up a logging plugin](setting-up-a-logging-plugin.md)

```shell
kubectl apply -R -f config/monitoring/100-common \
    -f config/monitoring/150-stackdriver \
    -f third_party/config/monitoring/common \
    -f config/monitoring/200-common \
    -f config/monitoring/200-common/100-istio.yaml
```
