Knative APIs build on existing Kubernetes APIs, so that Knative resources are compatible with other Kubernetes-native resources, and can be managed by cluster administrators using existing Kubernetes tools. Common languages and frameworks that include Kubernetes-friendly tooling work smoothly with Knative to reduce the time spent solving common deployment issues, such as: Deploying a container Routing and managing traffic with blue/green deployment Scaling automatically and sizing workloads based on demand Binding running services to eventing ecosystems There are two core Knative components that can be installed and used together or independently to provide different functions: Knative Serving : Easily manage stateless services on Kubernetes by reducing the developer effort required for autoscaling, networking, and rollouts. Knative Eventing : Easily route events between on-cluster and off-cluster components by exposing event routing as configuration rather than embedded in code. These components are delivered as Kubernetes custom resource definitions (CRDs), which can be configured by a cluster administrator to provide default settings for developer-created applications and event workflow components. Note : Earlier versions of Knative included a build component. That component has since evolved into the separate Tekton Pipelines project.

Functionality \u00b6 Knative Eventing supports multiple modes of usage. The following scenarios are well-supported by the existing components; since the system is modular, it's also possible to combine the components in novel ways. I just want to publish events, I don't care who consumes them. Send events to a Broker as an HTTP POST. Sink binding can be useful to decouple the destination configuration from your application. I just want to consume events like X, I don't care how they are published. Use a Trigger to consume events from a Broker based on CloudEvents attributes. Your application will receive the events as an HTTP POST. I want to transform events through a series of steps. Use Channels and Subscriptions to define complex message-passing topologies. For simple pipelines, the Sequence automates construction of Channels and Subscriptions between each stage. Knative also supports some additional patterns such as Parallel fanout of events, and routing response events from both Channels and Brokers. Design overview \u00b6 Knative Eventing is designed around the following goals: The Knative Eventing resources are loosely coupled. These resources can be developed and deployed independently on, and across a variety of platforms (for example Kubernetes, VMs, SaaS or FaaS). Event producers and event consumers are independent. Any producer (or source), can generate events before there are active event consumers that are listening. Any event consumer can express interest in an event or class of events, before there are producers that are creating those events. Other services can be connected to the Eventing system. These services can perform the following functions: Create new applications without modifying the event producer or event consumer. Select and target specific subsets of the events from their producers. Ensure cross-service interoperability. Knative Eventing is consistent with the CloudEvents specification that is developed by the CNCF Serverless WG . Event consumers \u00b6 To enable delivery to multiple types of Services, Knative Eventing defines two generic interfaces that can be implemented by multiple Kubernetes resources: Addressable objects are able to receive and acknowledge an event delivered over HTTP to an address defined in their status.address.url field. As a special case, the core Kubernetes Service object also fulfils the Addressable interface. Callable objects are able to receive an event delivered over HTTP and transform the event, returning 0 or 1 new events in the HTTP response. These returned events may be further processed in the same way that events from an external event source are processed. Event sources \u00b6 To learn about using event sources, see the event sources documentation. Event brokers and triggers \u00b6 Broker and Trigger objects make it easy to filter events based on event attributes. A Broker provides a bucket of events which can be selected by attribute. It receives events and forwards them to subscribers defined by one or more matching Triggers. Since a Broker implements Addressable, event senders can submit events to the Broker by POSTing the event to the Broker's status.address.url . A Trigger describes a filter on event attributes which should be delivered to an Addressable. You can create as many Triggers as necessary. For most use cases, a single bucket (Broker) per namespace is sufficient, but there are serveral use cases where multiple buckets (Brokers) can simplify architecture. For example, separate Brokers for events containing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and non-PII events can simplify audit and access control rules. Event registry \u00b6 Knative Eventing defines an EventType object to make it easier for consumers to discover the types of events they can consume from Brokers. The registry consists of a collection of event types. The event types stored in the registry contain (all) the required information for a consumer to create a Trigger without resorting to some other out-of-band mechanism. To learn how to use the registry, see the Event Registry documentation . Event channels and subscriptions \u00b6 Knative Eventing also defines an event forwarding and persistence layer, called a Channel . Each channel is a separate Kubernetes Custom Resource . Events are delivered to Services or forwarded to other channels (possibly of a different type) using Subscriptions . This allows message delivery in a cluster to vary based on requirements, so that some events might be handled by an in-memory implementation while others would be persisted using Apache Kafka or NATS Streaming. See the List of Channel implementations . Higher Level eventing constructs \u00b6 There are cases where you may want to utilize a set of co-operating functions together and for those use cases, Knative Eventing provides two additional resources: Sequence provides a way to define an in-order list of functions. Parallel provides a way to define a list of branches for events. Future design goals \u00b6 The focus for the next Eventing release will be to enable easy implementation of event sources. Sources manage registration and delivery of events from external systems using Kubernetes Custom Resources . Learn more about Eventing development in the Eventing work group .

Learn more Configuring tracing \u00b6 With the exception of importers, the Knative Eventing tracing is configured through the config-tracing ConfigMap in the knative-eventing namespace. Most importers do not use the ConfigMap and instead, use a static 1% sampling rate. You can use the config-tracing ConfigMap to configure the following Eventing components: - Brokers - Triggers - InMemoryChannel - ApiServerSource - PingSource - GitlabSource - KafkaSource - PrometheusSource Example: The following example config-tracing ConfigMap samples 10% of all CloudEvents: apiVersion : v1 kind : ConfigMap metadata : name : config-tracing namespace : knative-eventing data : enable : \"true\" zipkin-endpoint : \"http://zipkin.istio-system.svc.cluster.local:9411/api/v2/spans\" sample-rate : \"0.1\" Configuration options \u00b6 You can configure your config-tracing with following options: backend : Valid values are zipkin , stackdriver , or none . The default is none . zipkin-endpoint : Specifies the URL to the zipkin collector where you want to send the traces. Must be set if backend is set to zipkin . stackdriver-project-id : Specifies the GCP project ID into which the Stackdriver traces are written. You must specify the backend as stackdriver . If backend is unspecified, the GCP project ID is read from GCP metadata when running on GCP. sample-rate : Specifies the sampling rate. Valid values are decimals from 0 to 1 (interpreted as a float64), which indicate the probability that any given request is sampled. An example value is 0.5 , which gives each request a 50% sampling probablity. debug : Enables debugging. Valid values are true or false . Defaults to false when not specified. Set to true to enable debug mode, which forces the sample-rate to 1.0 and sends all spans to the server. Viewing your config-tracing ConfigMap \u00b6 To view your current configuration: kubectl -n knative-eventing get configmap config-tracing -oyaml Editing and deploying your config-tracing ConfigMap \u00b6 To edit and then immediately deploy changes to your ConfigMap, run the following command: kubectl -n knative-eventing edit configmap config-tracing Accessing traces in Eventing \u00b6 To access the traces, you use either the Zipkin or Jaeger tool. Details about using these tools to access traces are provided in the Knative Serving observability section: Zipkin Jaeger Example \u00b6 The following demonstrates how to trace requests in Knative Eventing with Zipkin, using the TestBrokerTracing End-to-End test. For this example, assume the following details: - Everything happens in the includes-incoming-trace-id-2qszn namespace. - The Broker is named br . - There are two Triggers that are associated with the Broker: - transformer - Filters to only allow events whose type is transformer . Sends the event to the Kubernetes Service transformer , which will reply with an identical event, except the replied event's type will be logger . - logger - Filters to only allow events whose type is logger . Sends the event to the Kubernetes Service logger . - An event is sent to the Broker with the type transformer , by the Pod named sender . Given the above, the expected path and behavior of an event is as follows: sender Pod sends the request to the Broker. Go to the Broker's ingress Pod. Go to the imc-dispatcher Channel (imc stands for InMemoryChannel). Go to both Triggers. Go to the Broker's filter Pod for the Trigger logger . The Trigger's filter ignores this event.

Configuring Subscription Delivery \u00b6 Knative Eventing offers fine-grained control on how events are delivered for each subscription by adding a delivery section. Consider this example: apiVersion : messaging.knative.dev/v1 kind : Subscription metadata : name : with-dead-letter-sink spec : channel : apiVersion : messaging.knative.dev/v1 kind : InMemoryChannel name : default delivery : deadLetterSink : ref : apiVersion : serving.knative.dev/v1 kind : Service name : error-handler subscriber : uri : http://doesnotexist.default.svc.cluster.local The deadLetterSink specifies where to send events that failed be consumed by subscriber . Configuring Broker Delivery \u00b6 Knative Eventing offers fine-grained control on how events are delivered for each broker by adding a delivery section. Consider this example: apiVersion : messaging.knative.dev/v1 kind : Subscription metadata : name : with-dead-letter-sink spec : channel : apiVersion : messaging.knative.dev/v1 kind : InMemoryChannel name : default delivery : retry : 5 backoffPolicy : exponential # or linear backoffDelay : \"PT0.5S\" # or ISO8601 duration deadLetterSink : ref : apiVersion : serving.knative.dev/v1 kind : Service name : error-handler subscriber : uri : http://doesnotexist.default.svc.cluster.local The Broker will retry sending events 5 times with a backoff delay of 500 milliseconds and exponential backoff policy.

Be familiar with the CloudEvents spec , particularly the Context Attributes section. Be familiar with event sources . Discovering events with the registry \u00b6 Using the registry, you can discover different types of events that can be consumed by broker event meshes. The registry is designed for use with the broker and trigger model, and aims to help you create triggers. To see event types in the registry that are available to subscribe to, enter the following command: kubectl get eventtypes -n <namespace> Below, we show an example output of executing the above command using the default namespace in a testing cluster.

The name is advisory (i.e., non-authoritative), and we typically generate it ( generateName ) to avoid naming collisions (e.g., two EventTypes listening to pull requests on two different Github repositories). As name nor generateName are needed for consumers to create Triggers, we defer their discussion for later on. Regarding status , its main purpose it to tell consumers (or cluster operators) whether the EventType is ready for consumption or not. That readiness is based on the Broker being ready. We can see from the example output that the PubSub EventType is not ready, as its dev Broker isn't. Let's talk in more details about the spec fields: type : is authoritative. This refers to the CloudEvent type as it enters into the event mesh. It is mandatory. Event consumers can (and in most cases would) create Triggers filtering on this attribute. source : refers to the CloudEvent source as it enters into the event mesh. It is mandatory. Event consumers can (and in most cases would) create Triggers filtering on this attribute. schema : is a valid URI with the EventType schema. It may be a JSON schema, a protobuf schema, etc. It is optional. description : is a string describing what the EventType is about. It is optional. broker refers to the Broker that can provide the EventType. It is mandatory. Subscribing to events \u00b6 Now that you know what events can be consumed from the Brokers' event meshes, you can create Triggers to subscribe to particular events. Here are a few example Triggers that subscribe to events using exact matching on type and/or source , based on the above registry output: Subscribes to GitHub pushes from any source. apiVersion : eventing.knative.dev/v1 kind : Trigger metadata : name : push-trigger namespace : default spec : broker : default filter : attributes : type : dev.knative.source.github.push subscriber : ref : apiVersion : serving.knative.dev/v1 kind : Service name : push-service As per the registry output above, only two sources exist for that particular type of event ( knative's eventing and serving repositories). If later on new sources are registered for GitHub pushes, this trigger will be able to consume them. Subscribes to GitHub pull requests from knative's eventing repository. apiVersion : eventing.knative.dev/v1 kind : Trigger metadata : name : gh-knative-eventing-pull-trigger namespace : default spec : broker : default filter : attributes : type : dev.knative.source.github.pull_request source : https://github.com/knative/eventing subscriber : ref : apiVersion : serving.knative.dev/v1 kind : Service name : gh-knative-eventing-pull-service Subscribes to Kafka messages sent to the knative-demo topic apiVersion : eventing.knative.dev/v1 kind : Trigger metadata : name : kafka-knative-demo-trigger namespace : default spec : broker : default filter : attributes : type : dev.knative.kafka.event source : /apis/v1/namespaces/default/kafkasources/kafka-sample#knative-demo subscriber : ref : apiVersion : serving.knative.dev/v1 kind : Service name : kafka-knative-demo-service Subscribes to PubSub messages from GCP's knative project sent to the testing topic apiVersion : eventing.knative.dev/v1 kind : Trigger metadata : name : gcp-pubsub-knative-testing-trigger namespace : default spec : broker : dev filter : attributes : source : //pubsub.googleapis.com/knative/topics/testing subscriber : ref : apiVersion : serving.knative.dev/v1 kind : Service name : gcp-pubsub-knative-testing-service Note that events won't be able to be consumed by this Trigger's subscriber until the Broker becomes ready. Populating the registry \u00b6 Now that we know how to discover events using the registry and how we can leverage that information to subscribe to events of interest, let's move on to the next topic: How do we actually populate the registry in the first place? Manual Registration In order to populate the registry, a cluster configurator can manually register the EventTypes. This means that the configurator can simply apply EventTypes yaml files, just as with any other Kubernetes resource: kubectl apply -f <event_type.yaml> Automatic Registration As Manual Registration might be tedious and error-prone, we also support automatic registration of EventTypes. The creation of the EventTypes is done upon instantiation of an Event Source. We currently support automatic registration of EventTypes for the following Event Sources: CronJobSource ApiServerSource GithubSource GcpPubSubSource KafkaSource AwsSqsSource Let's look at an example, in particular, the KafkaSource sample we used to populate the registry in our testing cluster. Below is what the yaml looks like. apiVersion : sources.knative.dev/v1beta1 kind : KafkaSource metadata : name : kafka-sample namespace : default spec : bootstrapServers : - my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.kafka:9092 topics : - knative-demo - news sink : apiVersion : eventing.knative.dev/v1 kind : Broker name : default If you are interested in more information regarding configuration options of a KafkaSource, please refer to the KafKaSource sample . For this discussion, the relevant information from the yaml above are the sink and the topics . We observe that the sink is of kind Broker . We currently only support automatic creation of EventTypes for Sources instances that point to Brokers. Regarding topics , this is what we use to generate the EventTypes source field, which is equal to the CloudEvent source attribute. When you kubectl apply this yaml, the KafkaSource kafka-source-sample will be instantiated, and two EventTypes will be added to the registry (as there are two topics). You can see that in the registry example output from the previous sections. What's next \u00b6 To get started, install Knative Eventing if you haven't yet, and try experimenting with different Event Sources in your Knative cluster. Installing Knative in case you haven't already done so. Getting started with eventing in case you haven't read it. Knative code samples is a useful resource to better understand some of the Event Sources (remember to point them to a Broker if you want automatic registration of EventTypes in the registry).","title":"Event Registry"},{"location":"eventing/event-registry/#overview","text":"The event registry maintains a catalog of event types that can be consumed from different brokers.

This guide shows how you can use a basic workflow for managing events. Before you start to manage events, you must create the objects needed to transport the events. Creating a Knative Eventing namespace \u00b6 Namespaces are used to group together and organize your Knative resources. Create a new namespace called event-example by entering the following command: kubectl create namespace event-example Adding a broker to the namespace \u00b6 The broker allows you to route events to different event sinks or consumers. Add a broker named default to your namespace by entering the following command: kubectl create -f - <<EOF apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1 kind: broker metadata: name: default namespace: event-example EOF Verify that the broker is working correctly, by entering the following command: kubectl -n event-example get broker default This shows information about your broker. If the broker is working correctly, it shows a READY status of True : NAME READY REASON URL AGE default True http://broker-ingress.knative-eventing.svc.cluster.local/event-example/default 1m If READY is False , wait a few moments and then run the command again. If you continue to receive the False status, see the Debugging Guide to troubleshoot the issue. Creating event consumers \u00b6 In this step, you create two event consumers, hello-display and goodbye-display , to demonstrate how you can configure your event producers to target a specific consumer. To deploy the hello-display consumer to your cluster, run the following command: kubectl -n event-example apply -f - << EOF apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: hello-display spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: &labels app: hello-display template: metadata: labels: *labels spec: containers: - name: event-display image: gcr.io/knative-releases/knative.dev/eventing-contrib/cmd/event_display --- kind: Service apiVersion: v1 metadata: name: hello-display spec: selector: app: hello-display ports: - protocol: TCP port: 80 targetPort: 8080 EOF To deploy the goodbye-display consumer to your cluster, run the following command: kubectl -n event-example apply -f - << EOF apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: goodbye-display spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: &labels app: goodbye-display template: metadata: labels: *labels spec: containers: - name: event-display # Source code: https://github.com/knative/eventing-contrib/tree/main/cmd/event_display image: gcr.io/knative-releases/knative.dev/eventing-contrib/cmd/event_display --- kind: Service apiVersion: v1 metadata: name: goodbye-display spec: selector: app: goodbye-display ports: - protocol: TCP port: 80 targetPort: 8080 EOF Verify that the event consumers are working by entering the following command: kubectl -n event-example get deployments hello-display goodbye-display This lists the hello-display and goodbye-display consumers that you deployed: NAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE hello-display 1/1 1 1 26s goodbye-display 1/1 1 1 16s The number of replicas in the READY column should match the number of replicas in the AVAILABLE column. If the numbers do not match, see the Debugging Guide to troubleshoot the issue. Creating triggers \u00b6 A trigger defines the events that each event consumer receives. Brokers use triggers to forward events to the correct consumers. Each trigger can specify a filter that enables selection of relevant events based on the Cloud Event context attributes. Create a trigger by entering the following command: kubectl -n event-example apply -f - << EOF apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1 kind: Trigger metadata: name: hello-display spec: broker: default filter: attributes: type: greeting subscriber: ref: apiVersion: v1 kind: Service name: hello-display EOF The command creates a trigger that sends all events of type greeting to your event consumer named hello-display . To add a second trigger, enter the following command: kubectl -n event-example apply -f - << EOF apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1 kind: Trigger metadata: name: goodbye-display spec: broker: default filter: attributes: source: sendoff subscriber: ref: apiVersion: v1 kind: Service name: goodbye-display EOF The command creates a trigger that sends all events of source sendoff to your event consumer named goodbye-display . Verify that the triggers are working correctly by running the following command: kubectl -n event-example get triggers This returns the hello-display and goodbye-display triggers that you created: NAME READY REASON BROKER SUBSCRIBER_URI AGE goodbye-display True default http://goodbye-display.event-example.svc.cluster.local/ 9s hello-display True default http://hello-display.event-example.svc.cluster.local/ 16s If the triggers are correctly configured, they will be ready and pointing to the correct broker ( default ) and SUBSCRIBER_URI . The SUBSCRIBER_URI has a value similar to triggerName.namespaceName.svc.cluster.local . The exact value depends on the broker implementation. If this value looks incorrect, see the Debugging Guide to troubleshoot the issue. Creating a pod as an event producer \u00b6 This guide uses curl commands to manually send individual events as HTTP requests to the broker, and demonstrate how these events are received by the correct event consumer. The broker can only be accessed from within the cluster where Knative Eventing is installed. You must create a pod within that cluster to act as an event producer that will execute the curl commands. To create a pod, enter the following command: kubectl -n event-example apply -f - << EOF apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: labels: run: curl name: curl spec: containers: # This could be any image that we can SSH into and has curl. - image: radial/busyboxplus:curl imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent name: curl resources: {} stdin: true terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log terminationMessagePolicy: File tty: true EOF Sending events to the broker \u00b6 SSH into the pod by running the following command: kubectl -n event-example attach curl -it You will see a prompt similar to the following: Defaulting container name to curl. Use 'kubectl describe pod/ -n event-example' to see all of the containers in this pod. If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter. [ root@curl:/ ]$ Make a HTTP request to the broker. To show the various types of events you can send, you will make three requests: To make the first request, which creates an event that has the type greeting , run the following in the SSH terminal: curl -v \"http://broker-ingress.knative-eventing.svc.cluster.local/event-example/default\" \\ -X POST \\ -H \"Ce-Id: say-hello\" \\ -H \"Ce-Specversion: 1.0\" \\ -H \"Ce-Type: greeting\" \\ -H \"Ce-Source: not-sendoff\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"msg\":\"Hello Knative!\"}' When the broker receives your event, hello-display will activate and send it to the event consumer of the same name. If the event has been received, you will receive a 202 Accepted response similar to the one below: < HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted < Content-Length: 0 < Date: Mon, 12 Aug 2019 19:48:18 GMT - To make the second request, which creates an event that has the source sendoff , run the following in the SSH terminal: curl -v \"http://broker-ingress.knative-eventing.svc.cluster.local/event-example/default\" \\ -X POST \\ -H \"Ce-Id: say-goodbye\" \\ -H \"Ce-Specversion: 1.0\" \\ -H \"Ce-Type: not-greeting\" \\ -H \"Ce-Source: sendoff\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"msg\":\"Goodbye Knative!\"}' When the broker receives your event, goodbye-display will activate and send the event to the event consumer of the same name.

You have sent two events to the hello-display event consumer and two events to the goodbye-display event consumer (note that say-hello-goodbye activates the trigger conditions for both hello-display and goodbye-display ). You will verify that these events were received correctly in the next section. Verifying that events were received \u00b6 After you send the events, verify that the events were received by the correct subscribers.

An Apache Kafka cluster (if you're just getting started you can follow Strimzi Quickstart page ). Installation \u00b6 Install the Kafka controller by entering the following command: kubectl apply --filename http://github.com/knative-sandbox/eventing-kafka-broker/releases/download/v0.20.0/eventing-kafka-controller.yaml Install the Kafka Broker data plane by entering the following command: kubectl apply --filename http://github.com/knative-sandbox/eventing-kafka-broker/releases/download/v0.20.0/eventing-kafka-broker.yaml Verify that kafka-controller , kafka-broker-receiver and kafka-broker-dispatcher are running, by entering the following command: kubectl get deployments.apps -n knative-eventing Example output: NAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE eventing-controller 1 /1 1 1 10s eventing-webhook 1 /1 1 1 9s kafka-controller 1 /1 1 1 3s kafka-broker-dispatcher 1 /1 1 1 4s kafka-broker-receiver 1 /1 1 1 5s Create a Kafka Broker \u00b6 A Kafka Broker object looks like this: apiVersion : eventing.knative.dev/v1 kind : Broker metadata : annotations : # case-sensitive eventing.knative.dev/broker.class : Kafka name : default namespace : default spec : # Configuration specific to this broker. config : apiVersion : v1 kind : ConfigMap name : kafka-broker-config namespace : knative-eventing # Optional dead letter sink, you can specify either: # - deadLetterSink.ref, which is a reference to a Callable # - deadLetterSink.uri, which is an absolute URI to a Callable (It can potentially be out of the Kubernetes cluster) delivery : deadLetterSink : ref : apiVersion : serving.knative.dev/v1 kind : Service name : dlq-service spec.config should reference any ConfigMap that looks like the following: apiVersion : v1 kind : ConfigMap metadata : name : kafka-broker-config namespace : knative-eventing data : # Number of topic partitions default.topic.partitions : \"10\" # Replication factor of topic messages. default.topic.replication.factor : \"1\" # A comma separated list of bootstrap servers. (It can be in or out the k8s cluster) bootstrap.servers : \"my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.kafka:9092\" The above ConfigMap is installed in the cluster. You can edit the configuration or create a new one with the same values depending on your needs. NOTE: The default.topic.replication.factor value must be less than or equal to the number of Kafka broker instances in your cluster. For example, if you only have one Kafka broker, the default.topic.replication.factor value should not be more than 1 . Set as default broker implementation \u00b6 To set the Kafka broker as the default implementation for all brokers in the Knative deployment, you can apply global settings by modifying the config-br-defaults ConfigMap in the knative-eventing namespace. This allows you to avoid configuring individual or per-namespace settings for each broker, such as metadata.annotations.eventing.knative.dev/broker.class or spec.config . The following YAML is an example of a config-br-defaults ConfigMap using Kafka broker as the default implementation. apiVersion : v1 kind : ConfigMap metadata : name : config-br-defaults namespace : knative-eventing data : default-br-config : | clusterDefault: brokerClass: Kafka apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap name: kafka-broker-config namespace: knative-eventing namespaceDefaults: namespace1: brokerClass: Kafka apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap name: kafka-broker-config namespace: knative-eventing namespace2: brokerClass: Kafka apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap name: kafka-broker-config namespace: knative-eventing Security \u00b6 Apache Kafka supports different security features, Knative supports the followings: Authentication using SASL without encryption Authentication using SASL and encryption using SSL Authentication and encryption using SSL Encryption using SSL without client authentication To enable security features, in the ConfigMap referenced by broker.spec.config , we can reference a Secret : apiVersion : v1 kind : ConfigMap metadata : name : kafka-broker-config namespace : knative-eventing data : # Other configurations # ... # Reference a Secret called my_secret auth.secret.ref.name : my_secret The Secret my_secret must exist in the same namespace of the ConfigMap referenced by broker.spec.config , in this case: knative-eventing . Note: Certificates and keys must be in PEM format . Authentication using SASL \u00b6 Knative supports the following SASL mechanisms: PLAIN SCRAM-SHA-256 SCRAM-SHA-512 To use a specific SASL mechanism replace <sasl_mechanism> with the mechanism of your choice. Authentication using SASL without encryption \u00b6 kubectl create secret --namespace <namespace> generic <my_secret> \\ --from-literal = protocol = SASL_PLAINTEXT \\ --from-literal = sasl.mechanism = <sasl_mechanism> \\ --from-literal = user = <my_user> \\ --from-literal = password = <my_password> Authentication using SASL and encryption using SSL \u00b6 kubectl create secret --namespace <namespace> generic <my_secret> \\ --from-literal = protocol = SASL_SSL \\ --from-literal = sasl.mechanism = <sasl_mechanism> \\ --from-file = ca.crt = caroot.pem \\ --from-literal = user = <my_user> \\ --from-literal = password = <my_password> Encryption using SSL without client authentication \u00b6 kubectl create secret --namespace <namespace> generic <my_secret> \\ --from-literal = protocol = SSL \\ --from-file = ca.crt = <my_caroot.pem_file_path> \\ --from-literal = user.skip = true Authentication and encryption using SSL \u00b6 kubectl create secret --namespace <namespace> generic <my_secret> \\ --from-literal = protocol = SSL \\ --from-file = ca.crt = <my_caroot.pem_file_path> \\ --from-file = user.crt = <my_cert.pem_file_path> \\ --from-file = user.key = <my_key.pem_file_path> NOTE: ca.crt can be omitted to fallback to use system's root CA set. Kafka Producer and Consumer configurations \u00b6 Knative exposes all available Kafka producer and consumer configurations that can be modified to suit your workloads. You can change these configurations by modifying the config-kafka-broker-data-plane ConfigMap in the knative-eventing namespace. Documentation for the settings available in this ConfigMap is available on the Apache Kafka website , in particular, Producer configurations and Consumer configurations . Enable debug logging for data plane components \u00b6 The following YAML shows the default logging configuration for data plane components, that is created during the installation step: apiVersion : v1 kind : ConfigMap metadata : name : kafka-config-logging namespace : knative-eventing data : config.xml : | <configuration> <appender name=\"jsonConsoleAppender\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder class=\"net.logstash.logback.encoder.LogstashEncoder\"/> </appender> <root level=\"INFO\"> <appender-ref ref=\"jsonConsoleAppender\"/> </root> </configuration> To change the logging level to DEBUG , you must: Apply the following kafka-config-logging ConfigMap or replace level=\"INFO\" with level=\"DEBUG\" to the ConfigMap kafka-config-logging : apiVersion : v1 kind : ConfigMap metadata : name : kafka-config-logging namespace : knative-eventing data : config.xml : | <configuration> <appender name=\"jsonConsoleAppender\" class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender\"> <encoder class=\"net.logstash.logback.encoder.LogstashEncoder\"/> </appender> <root level=\"DEBUG\"> <appender-ref ref=\"jsonConsoleAppender\"/> </root> </configuration> Restart the kafka-broker-receiver and the kafka-broker-dispatcher , by entering the following commands: kubectl rollout restart deployment -n knative-eventing kafka-broker-receiver kubectl rollout restart deployment -n knative-eventing kafka-broker-dispatcher Configuring the order of delivered events \u00b6 When dispatching events, the Kafka broker can be configured to support different delivery ordering guarantees. You can configure the delivery order of events using the kafka.eventing.knative.dev/delivery.order annotation on the Trigger object: apiVersion : eventing.knative.dev/v1 kind : Trigger metadata : name : my-service-trigger annotations : kafka.eventing.knative.dev/delivery.order : ordered spec : broker : my-kafka-broker subscriber : ref : apiVersion : serving.knative.dev/v1 kind : Service name : my-service The supported consumer delivery guarantees are: unordered : Unordered consumer is a non-blocking consumer that potentially delivers messages unordered, while preserving proper offset management. ordered : Ordered consumer is a per-partition blocking consumer that delivers messages in order. unordered is the default ordering guarantee, while ordered is considered unstable, use with caution .

Audience \u00b6 This document is intended for people that are familiar with the object model of Knative Eventing . You don't need to be an expert, but do need to know roughly how things fit together. Prerequisites \u00b6 Setup Knative Eventing and an Eventing-contrib resource . Example \u00b6 This guide uses an example consisting of an event source that sends events to a function. See example.yaml for the entire YAML. For any commands in this guide to work, you must apply example.yaml : kubectl apply --filename example.yaml Triggering Events \u00b6 Knative events will occur whenever a Kubernetes Event occurs in the knative-debug namespace. We can cause this to occur with the following commands: kubectl --namespace knative-debug run to-be-deleted --image = image-that-doesnt-exist --restart = Never # 5 seconds is arbitrary. We want K8s to notice that the Pod needs to be scheduled and generate at least one event. sleep 5 kubectl --namespace knative-debug delete pod to-be-deleted Then we can see the Kubernetes Event s (note that these are not Knative events!): kubectl --namespace knative-debug get events This should produce output along the lines of: LAST SEEN FIRST SEEN COUNT NAME KIND SUBOBJECT TYPE REASON SOURCE MESSAGE 20s 20s 1 to-be-deleted.157aadb9f376fc4e Pod Normal Scheduled default-scheduler Successfully assigned knative-debug/to-be-deleted to gke-kn24-default-pool-c12ac83b-pjf2 Where are my events? \u00b6 You've applied example.yaml and you are inspecting fn 's logs: kubectl --namespace knative-debug logs -l app = fn -c user-container But you don't see any events arrive. Where is the problem? Control Plane \u00b6 We will first check the control plane, to ensure everything should be working properly. Resources \u00b6 The first thing to check are all the created resources, do their statuses contain ready true? We will attempt to determine why from the most basic pieces out: fn - The Deployment has no dependencies inside Knative. svc - The Service has no dependencies inside Knative. chan - The Channel depends on its backing channel implementation and somewhat depends on sub . src - The Source depends on chan . sub - The Subscription depends on both chan and svc . fn \u00b6 kubectl --namespace knative-debug get deployment fn -o jsonpath = '{.status.availableReplicas}' We want to see 1 . If you don't, then you need to debug the Deployment . Is there anything obviously wrong mentioned in the status ? kubectl --namespace knative-debug get deployment fn --output yaml If it is not obvious what is wrong, then you need to debug the Deployment , which is out of scope of this document. Verify that the Pod is Ready : kubectl --namespace knative-debug get pod -l app = fn -o jsonpath = '{.items[*].status.conditions[?(@.type == \"Ready\")].status}' This should return True . If it doesn't, then try to debug the Deployment using the Kubernetes Application Debugging guide. svc \u00b6 kubectl --namespace knative-debug get service svc We just want to ensure this exists and has the correct name. If it doesn't exist, then you probably need to re-apply example.yaml . Verify it points at the expected pod. svcLabels = $( kubectl --namespace knative-debug get service svc -o go-template = '{{range $k, $v := .spec.selector}}{{ $k }}={{ $v }},{{ end }}' | sed 's/.$//' ) kubectl --namespace knative-debug get pods -l $svcLabels This should return a single Pod, which if you inspect is the one generated by fn . chan \u00b6 chan uses the in-memory-channel . This is a very basic channel and has few failure modes that will be exhibited in chan 's status . kubectl --namespace knative-debug get channel.messaging.knative.dev chan -o jsonpath = '{.status.conditions[?(@.type == \"Ready\")].status}' This should return True . If it doesn't, get the full resource: kubectl --namespace knative-debug get channel.messaging.knative.dev chan --output yaml If status is completely missing, it implies that something is wrong with the in-memory-channel controller. See Channel Controller . Next verify that chan is addressable: kubectl --namespace knative-debug get channel.messaging.knative.dev chan -o jsonpath = '{.status.address.hostname}' This should return a URI, likely ending in '.cluster.local'. If it doesn't, then it implies that something went wrong during reconciliation. See Channel Controller . We will verify that the two resources that the chan creates exist and are Ready . Service \u00b6 chan creates a K8s Service . kubectl --namespace knative-debug get service -l messaging.knative.dev/role = in -memory-channel It's spec is completely unimportant, as Istio will ignore it. It just needs to exist so that src can send events to it. If it doesn't exist, it implies that something went wrong during chan reconciliation. See Channel Controller . src \u00b6 src is a ApiServerSource . First we will verify that src is writing to chan . kubectl --namespace knative-debug get apiserversource src -o jsonpath = '{.spec.sink}' Which should return map[apiVersion:messaging.knative.dev/v1 kind:Channel name:chan] . If it doesn't, then src was setup incorrectly and its spec needs to be fixed. Fixing should be as simple as updating its spec to have the correct sink (see example.yaml ). Now that we know src is sending to chan , let's verify that it is Ready . kubectl --namespace knative-debug get apiserversource src -o jsonpath = '{.status.conditions[?(.type == \"Ready\")].status}' sub \u00b6 sub is a Subscription from chan to fn . Verify that sub is Ready : kubectl --namespace knative-debug get subscription sub -o jsonpath = '{.status.conditions[?(.type == \"Ready\")].status}' This should return True . If it doesn't then, look at all the status entries. kubectl --namespace knative-debug get subscription sub --output yaml Controllers \u00b6 Each of the resources has a Controller that is watching it. As of today, they tend to do a poor job of writing failure status messages and events, so we need to look at the Controller's logs. Deployment Controller \u00b6 The Kubernetes Deployment Controller, controlling fn , is out of scope for this document. Service Controller \u00b6 The Kubernetes Service Controller, controlling svc , is out of scope for this document. Channel Controller \u00b6 There is not a single Channel Controller. Instead, there is one Controller for each Channel CRD. chan uses the InMemoryChannel Channel CRD , whose Controller is: kubectl --namespace knative-eventing get pod -l messaging.knative.dev/channel = in -memory-channel,messaging.knative.dev/role = controller --output yaml See its logs with: kubectl --namespace knative-eventing logs -l messaging.knative.dev/channel = in -memory-channel,messaging.knative.dev/role = controller Pay particular attention to any lines that have a logging level of warning or error . Source Controller \u00b6 Each Source will have its own Controller. src is a ApiServerSource , so its Controller is: kubectl --namespace knative-eventing get pod -l app = sources-controller This is actually a single binary that runs multiple Source Controllers, importantly including ApiServerSource Controller . ApiServerSource Controller \u00b6 The ApiServerSource Controller is run in the same binary as some other Source Controllers from Eventing. It is: kubectl --namespace knative-debug get pod -l eventing.knative.dev/sourceName = src,eventing.knative.dev/source = apiserver-source-controller View its logs with: kubectl --namespace knative-debug logs -l eventing.knative.dev/sourceName = src,eventing.knative.dev/source = apiserver-source-controller Pay particular attention to any lines that have a logging level of warning or error . Subscription Controller \u00b6 The Subscription Controller controls sub . It attempts to resolve the addresses that a Channel should send events to, and once resolved, inject those into the Channel 's spec.subscribable . kubectl --namespace knative-eventing get pod -l app = eventing-controller View its logs with: kubectl --namespace knative-eventing logs -l app = eventing-controller Pay particular attention to any lines that have a logging level of warning or error . Data Plane \u00b6 The entire Control Plane looks healthy, but we're still not getting any events. Now we need to investigate the data plane. The Knative event takes the following path: Event is generated by src . In this case, it is caused by having a Kubernetes Event trigger it, but as far as Knative is concerned, the Source is generating the event denovo (from nothing). src is POSTing the event to chan 's address, http://chan-kn-channel.knative-debug.svc.cluster.local . The Channel Dispatcher receives the request and introspects the Host header to determine which Channel it corresponds to. It sees that it corresponds to knative-debug/chan so forwards the request to the subscribers defined in sub , in particular svc , which is backed by fn . fn receives the request and logs it. We will investigate components in the order in which events should travel. Channel Dispatcher \u00b6 The Channel Dispatcher is the component that receives POSTs pushing events into Channel s and then POSTs to subscribers of those Channel s when an event is received. For the in-memory-channel used in this example, there is a single binary that handles both the receiving and dispatching sides for all in-memory-channel Channel s. First we will inspect the Dispatcher's logs to see if it is anything obvious: kubectl --namespace knative-eventing logs -l messaging.knative.dev/channel = in -memory-channel,messaging.knative.dev/role = dispatcher -c dispatcher Ideally we will see lines like: { \"level\" : \"info\" , \"ts\" : \"2019-08-16T13:50:55.424Z\" , \"logger\" : \"inmemorychannel-dispatcher.in-memory-channel-dispatcher\" , \"caller\" : \"provisioners/message_receiver.go:147\" , \"msg\" : \"Request mapped to channel: knative-debug/chan-kn-channel\" , \"knative.dev/controller\" : \"in-memory-channel-dispatcher\" } { \"level\" : \"info\" , \"ts\" : \"2019-08-16T13:50:55.425Z\" , \"logger\" : \"inmemorychannel-dispatcher.in-memory-channel-dispatcher\" , \"caller\" : \"provisioners/message_dispatcher.go:112\" , \"msg\" : \"Dispatching message to http://svc.knative-debug.svc.cluster.local/\" , \"knative.dev/controller\" : \"in-memory-channel-dispatcher\" } { \"level\" : \"info\" , \"ts\" : \"2019-08-16T13:50:55.981Z\" , \"logger\" : \"inmemorychannel-dispatcher.in-memory-channel-dispatcher\" , \"caller\" : \"provisioners/message_receiver.go:140\" , \"msg\" : \"Received request for chan-kn-channel.knative-debug.svc.cluster.local\" , \"knative.dev/controller\" : \"in-memory-channel-dispatcher\" } Which shows that the request is being received and then sent to svc , which is returning a 2XX response code (likely 200, 202, or 204). However if we see something like: { \"level\" : \"info\" , \"ts\" : \"2019-08-16T16:10:16.859Z\" , \"logger\" : \"inmemorychannel-dispatcher.in-memory-channel-dispatcher\" , \"caller\" : \"provisioners/message_receiver.go:140\" , \"msg\" : \"Received request for chan-kn-channel.knative-debug.svc.cluster.local\" , \"knative.dev/controller\" : \"in-memory-channel-dispatcher\" } { \"level\" : \"info\" , \"ts\" : \"2019-08-16T16:10:16.859Z\" , \"logger\" : \"inmemorychannel-dispatcher.in-memory-channel-dispatcher\" , \"caller\" : \"provisioners/message_receiver.go:147\" , \"msg\" : \"Request mapped to channel: knative-debug/chan-kn-channel\" , \"knative.dev/controller\" : \"in-memory-channel-dispatcher\" } { \"level\" : \"info\" , \"ts\" : \"2019-08-16T16:10:16.859Z\" , \"logger\" : \"inmemorychannel-dispatcher.in-memory-channel-dispatcher\" , \"caller\" : \"provisioners/message_dispatcher.go:112\" , \"msg\" : \"Dispatching message to http://svc.knative-debug.svc.cluster.local/\" , \"knative.dev/controller\" : \"in-memory-channel-dispatcher\" } { \"level\" : \"error\" , \"ts\" : \"2019-08-16T16:10:38.169Z\" , \"logger\" : \"inmemorychannel-dispatcher.in-memory-channel-dispatcher\" , \"caller\" : \"fanout/fanout_handler.go:121\" , \"msg\" : \"Fanout had an error\" , \"knative.dev/controller\" : \"in-memory-channel-dispatcher\" , \"error\" : \"Unable to complete request Post http://svc.knative-debug.svc.cluster.local/: dial tcp 10.4.44.156:80: i/o timeout\" , \"stacktrace\" : \"knative.dev/eventing/pkg/provisioners/fanout.(*Handler).dispatch\\n\\t/Users/xxxxxx/go/src/knative.dev/eventing/pkg/provisioners/fanout/fanout_handler.go:121\\nknative.dev/eventing/pkg/provisioners/fanout.createReceiverFunction.func1.1\\n\\t/Users/i512777/go/src/knative.dev/eventing/pkg/provisioners/fanout/fanout_handler.go:95\" } Then we know there was a problem posting to http://svc.knative-debug.svc.cluster.local/ .

These event sources are highly dynamic and allow you to generate events from a variety of systems (cloud platforms, social networks, datastores, message brokers, legacy systems, etc.), leveraging all the 300+ components provided by Apache Camel . All Camel Sources use Apache Camel K as the runtime engine. Prerequisites \u00b6 Install Knative Serving and Eventing . Install the Apache Camel K Operator in any namespace where you want to run Camel sources. The preferred version that is compatible with Camel sources is Camel K v1.0.0-M4 . Installation instructions are provided in the Apache Camel K Manual . Documentation includes specific instructions for common Kubernetes environments, including development clusters. Install the Camel Source from the camel.yaml in the Eventing Sources release page : kubectl apply --filename camel.yaml Create Test Resources \u00b6 All the CamelSource examples use some test resources for the purpose of displaying the generated events. The following resources need to be created: a simple Knative event display service that prints incoming events to its log an in-memory channel named camel-test that buffers events created by the event source a subscription to direct events from the test channel to the event display service Deploy the display_resources.yaml : kubectl apply --filename display_resources.yaml Run a Timer CamelSource \u00b6 The samples directory contains some sample sources that can be used to generate events. The simplest example of CamelSource , that does not require additional configuration, is the timer source. The timer source periodically generates \"Hello world!\" events and forwards them to the provided destination. If you want, you can customize the source behavior using options available in the Apache Camel documentation for the timer component . All Camel components are documented in the Apache Camel Website . Install the timer CamelSource from source: kubectl apply -f source_timer.yaml Verify that the published events were sent into the Knative eventing system by looking at what is downstream of the CamelSource . kubectl logs --selector serving.knative.dev/service = camel-event-display -c user-container If you have deployed the timer source, you should see new log lines appearing every 3 seconds. Run a MQTT CamelSource \u00b6 One of the 300+ Camel components that you can leverage is Camel-Paho , based on the Eclipse Paho open source project. A source based on Paho (like the provided MQTT CamelSource ) allows to bridge any MQTT broker to a Knative resource, automatically converting IoT messages to Cloudevents. To use the MQTT source, you need a MQTT broker running and reachable from your cluster. For example, it's possible to run a Mosquito MQTT Broker for testing purposes. First, edit the MQTT CamelSource and put the correct address of the MQTT broker in the brokerUrl field. You also need to provide the name of the topic that you want to subscribe to: just change paho:mytopic to match the topic that you want to use. You can also scale this source out, in order to obtain more throughput, by changing the value of the replicas field. By default it creates 2 replicas for demonstration purposes. To reduce noise in the event display, you can remove all previously created CamelSources from the namespace: kubectl delete camelsource --all Install the mqtt CamelSource : kubectl apply -f source_mqtt.yaml You can now send MQTT messages to your broker using your favourite client (you can even use Camel K for sending test events). Each message you send to the MQTT broker will be printed by the event display as a Cloudevent. You can verify that your messages reach the event display by checking its logs: kubectl logs --selector serving.knative.dev/service = camel-event-display -c user-container Run a Telegram CamelSource \u00b6 Another useful component available with Camel is the Telegram component. It can be used to forward messages of a Telegram chat into Knative channels as events. Before using the provided Telegram CamelSource example, you need to follow the instructions on the Telegram website for creating a Telegram Bot . The quickest way to create a bot is to contact the Bot Father , another Telegram Bot, using your preferred Telegram client (mobile or web). After you create the bot, you will receive an authorization token that is needed for the source to work. First, edit the telegram CamelSource and put the authorization token, replacing the <put-your-token-here> placeholder. To reduce noise in the event display, you can remove all previously created CamelSources from the namespace: kubectl delete camelsource --all Install the telegram CamelSource : kubectl apply -f source_telegram.yaml Now, you can contact your bot with any Telegram client. Each message you send to the bot will be printed by the event display as a Cloudevent. You can verify that your messages reach the event display by checking its logs: kubectl logs --selector serving.knative.dev/service = camel-event-display -c user-container Run an HTTP Poller CamelSource \u00b6 CamelSources are not limited to using a single Camel component. For example, you can combine the Camel Timer component with the Camel HTTP component to periodically fetch an external API, transform the result into a Cloudevent and forward it to a given destination. The example will retrieve a static JSON file from a remote URL, but you can edit the HTTP poller CamelSource to add your own API. If you have previously deployed other CamelSources, to reduce noise in the event display, you can remove them all from the namespace: kubectl delete camelsource --all Install the HTTP poller CamelSource : kubectl apply -f source_http_poller.yaml The event display will show some JSON data periodically pulled from the external REST API.

A source based on Paho (like the provided MQTT CamelSource ) allows to bridge any MQTT broker to a Knative resource, automatically converting IoT messages to Cloudevents. To use the MQTT source, you need a MQTT broker running and reachable from your cluster. For example, it's possible to run a Mosquito MQTT Broker for testing purposes. First, edit the MQTT CamelSource and put the correct address of the MQTT broker in the brokerUrl field. You also need to provide the name of the topic that you want to subscribe to: just change paho:mytopic to match the topic that you want to use. You can also scale this source out, in order to obtain more throughput, by changing the value of the replicas field. By default it creates 2 replicas for demonstration purposes. To reduce noise in the event display, you can remove all previously created CamelSources from the namespace: kubectl delete camelsource --all Install the mqtt CamelSource : kubectl apply -f source_mqtt.yaml You can now send MQTT messages to your broker using your favourite client (you can even use Camel K for sending test events).

We will deploy the app as a Kubernetes Deployment along with a Kubernetes Service . However, you can also deploy the app as a Knative Serving Service . Follow the steps below to create the sample code and then deploy the app to your cluster. You can also download a working copy of the sample, by running the following commands: # Clone the relevant branch version such as \"release-0.13\" git clone -b \"v0.21.x\" https://github.com/knative/docs knative-docs cd knative-docs/docs/eventing/samples/helloworld/helloworld-python Before you begin \u00b6 A Kubernetes cluster with Knative Eventing installed.

A sink can be a k8s service, including Knative Services, a Channel, or a Broker that receives events from an event source. Event sources are created by instantiating a CR from a Source object. The Source object defines the arguments and parameters needed to instantiate a CR. All Sources are part of the sources category. You can list existing event sources on your cluster by entering the command: Kubectl kubectl get sources Kn kn source list Knative Sources \u00b6 Name API Version Maintainer Description APIServerSource v1 Knative Brings Kubernetes API server events into Knative. The APIServerSource fires a new event each time a Kubernetes resource is created, updated or deleted. AWS SQS v1alpha1 Knative Brings AWS Simple Queue Service messages into Knative. The AwsSqsSource fires a new event each time an event is published on an AWS SQS topic . Apache Camel v1alpha1 Knative Enables use of Apache Camel components for pushing events into Knative. A CamelSource is an event source that can represent any existing Apache Camel component , that provides a consumer side, and enables publishing events to an addressable endpoint. Each Camel endpoint has the form of a URI where the scheme is the ID of the component to use. CamelSource requires Camel-K to be installed into the current namespace. See the CamelSource example. Apache CouchDB v1alpha1 Knative Brings Apache CouchDB messages into Knative. Apache Kafka v1beta1 Knative Brings Apache Kafka messages into Knative. The KafkaSource reads events from an Apache Kafka Cluster, and passes these events to a sink so that they can be consumed. See the Kafka Source example for more details. Container Source v1 Knative The ContainerSource will instantiate container image(s) that can generate events until the ContainerSource is deleted. This may be used, for example, to poll an FTP server for new files or generate events at a set time interval. Given a spec.template with at least a container image specified, ContainerSource will keep a Pod running with the specified image(s). K_SINK (destination address) and KE_CE_OVERRIDES (JSON CloudEvents attributes) environment variables are injected into the running image(s). It is used by multiple other Sources as underlying infrastructure. Refer to the Container Source example for more details. GitHub v1alpha1 Knative Registers for events of the specified types on the specified GitHub organization or repository, and brings those events into Knative. The GitHubSource fires a new event for selected GitHub event types . See the GitHub Source example for more details. GitLab v1alpha1 Knative Registers for events of the specified types on the specified GitLab repository, and brings those events into Knative. The GitLabSource creates a webhooks for specified event types , listens for incoming events, and passes them to a consumer. See the GitLab Source example for more details. Heartbeats N/A Knative Uses an in-memory timer to produce events at the specified interval. PingSource v1beta2 Knative Produces events with a fixed payload on a specified Cron schedule. See the Ping Source example for more details. RabbitMQ Active development None Brings RabbitMQ messages into Knative. SinkBinding v1 Knative The SinkBinding can be used to author new event sources using any of the familiar compute abstractions that Kubernetes makes available (e.g. Deployment, Job, DaemonSet, StatefulSet), or Knative abstractions (e.g. Service, Configuration). SinkBinding provides a framework for injecting K_SINK (destination address) and K_CE_OVERRIDES (JSON cloudevents attributes) environment variables into any Kubernetes resource which has a spec.template that looks like a Pod (aka PodSpecable). See the SinkBinding example for more details. WebSocket N/A Knative Opens a WebSocket to the specified source and packages each received message as a Knative event. Third-Party Sources \u00b6 Name API Version Maintainer Description Auto Container Source Proof of Concept None AutoContainerSource is a controller that allows the Source CRDs without needing a controller.

The KafkaSource reads events from an Apache Kafka Cluster, and passes these events to a sink so that they can be consumed. See the Kafka Source example for more details. Container Source v1 Knative The ContainerSource will instantiate container image(s) that can generate events until the ContainerSource is deleted. This may be used, for example, to poll an FTP server for new files or generate events at a set time interval. Given a spec.template with at least a container image specified, ContainerSource will keep a Pod running with the specified image(s). K_SINK (destination address) and KE_CE_OVERRIDES (JSON CloudEvents attributes) environment variables are injected into the running image(s). It is used by multiple other Sources as underlying infrastructure. Refer to the Container Source example for more details.

You can use sink binding to connect Kubernetes resources that embed a PodSpec and want to produce events, such as an event source, to an addressable Kubernetes object that can receive events, also known as an event sink . Sink binding can be used to create new event sources using any of the familiar compute objects that Kubernetes makes available. For example, Deployment , Job , DaemonSet , or StatefulSet objects, or Knative abstractions, such as Service or Configuration objects, can be used. Sink binding injects environment variables into the PodTemplateSpec of the event sink, so that the application code does not need to interact directly with the Kubernetes API to locate the event destination. Sink binding operates in one of two modes; Inclusion or Exclusion . You can set the mode by modifying the SINK_BINDING_SELECTION_MODE of the eventing-webhook deployment accordingly. The mode determines the default scope of the webhook. By default, the webhook is set to exclusion mode, which means that any namespace that does not have the label bindings.knative.dev/exclude: true will be subject to mutation evalutation. If SINK_BINDING_SELECTION_MODE is set to inclusion , only the resources in a namespace labelled with bindings.knative.dev/include: true will be considered. In inclusion mode, any SinkBinding resource created will automatically label the subject namespace with bindings.knative.dev/include: true for inclusion in the potential environment variable inclusions. Getting started \u00b6 The following procedures show how you can create a sink binding and connect it to a service and event source in your cluster. Creating a namespace \u00b6 Create a namespace called sinkbinding-example : kubectl create namespace sinkbinding-example Creating a Knative service \u00b6 Create a Knative service if you do not have an existing event sink that you want to connect to the sink binding. Prerequisites \u00b6 You must have Knative Serving installed on your cluster. Optional: If you want to use kn commands with sink binding, you must install the kn CLI. Procedure \u00b6 Create a Knative service: Kn kn service create hello --image gcr.io/knative-releases/knative.dev/eventing-contrib/cmd/event_display --env RESPONSE = \"Hello Serverless!\" YAML Copy the sample YAML into a service.yaml file: apiVersion : serving.knative.dev/v1 kind : Service metadata : name : event-display spec : template : spec : containers : - image : gcr.io/knative-releases/knative.dev/eventing-contrib/cmd/event_display Apply the file: kubectl apply --filename service.yaml Creating a cron job \u00b6 Create a cron job if you do not have an existing event source that you want to connect to the sink binding.

Using a ContainerSource is a simple way to turn any dispatcher container into a Knative event source. Using SinkBinding provides a framework for injecting environment variables into any Kubernetes resource that has a spec.template and is PodSpecable . ContainerSource and SinkBinding both work by injecting environment variables to an application. Injected environment variables at minimum contain the URL of a sink that will receive events. Bootstrapping \u00b6 Create the project and add the dependencies: npm init npm install cloudevents-sdk@2.0.1 --save NOTE: Due to this bug , you must use version 2.0.1 of the Javascript SDK or newer. Using ContainerSource \u00b6 A ContainerSource creates a container for your event source image and manages this container. The sink URL to post the events will be made available to the application through the K_SINK environment variable by the ContainerSource. Example \u00b6 The following example event source emits an event to the sink every 1000 milliseconds: // File - index.js const { CloudEvent , HTTPEmitter } = require ( \"cloudevents-sdk\" ); let sinkUrl = process . env [ 'K_SINK' ]; console . log ( \"Sink URL is \" + sinkUrl ); let emitter = new HTTPEmitter ({ url : sinkUrl }); let eventIndex = 0 ; setInterval ( function () { console . log ( \"Emitting event #\" + ++ eventIndex ); let myevent = new CloudEvent ({ source : \"urn:event:from:my-api/resource/123\" , type : \"your.event.source.type\" , id : \"your-event-id\" , dataContentType : \"application/json\" , data : { \"hello\" : \"World \" + eventIndex }, }); // Emit the event emitter . send ( myevent ) . then ( response => { // Treat the response console . log ( \"Event posted successfully\" ); console . log ( response . data ); }) . catch ( err => { // Deal with errors console . log ( \"Error during event post\" ); console . error ( err ); }); }, 1000 ); # File - Dockerfile FROM node:10 WORKDIR /usr/src/app COPY package*.json ./ RUN npm install COPY . . EXPOSE 8080 CMD [ \"node\" , \"index.js\" ] The example code uses Binary mode for CloudEvents. To employ structured code, change let binding = new v1.BinaryHTTPEmitter(config); to let binding = new v1.StructuredHTTPEmitter(config); . Binary mode is used in most cases because: - It is faster in terms of serialization and deserialization. - It works better with CloudEvent-aware proxies, such as Knative Channels, and can simply check the header instead of parsing the payload. Procedure \u00b6 Build and push the image: docker build . -t path/to/image/registry/node-knative-heartbeat-source:v1 docker push path/to/image/registry/node-knative-heartbeat-source:v1 Create the event display service which logs any CloudEvents posted to it: apiVersion : serving.knative.dev/v1 kind : Service metadata : name : event-display spec : template : spec : containers : - image : docker.io/aliok/event_display-864884f202126ec3150c5fcef437d90c@sha256:93cb4dcda8fee80a1f68662ae6bf20301471b046ede628f3c3f94f39752fbe08 Create the ContainerSource object: apiVersion : sources.knative.dev/v1 kind : ContainerSource metadata : name : test-heartbeats spec : template : spec : containers : - image : path/to/image/registry/node-knative-heartbeat-source:v1 name : heartbeats sink : ref : apiVersion : serving.knative.dev/v1 kind : Service name : event-display Check the logs of the event display service.

It injects the sink information to an already existing Kubernetes resources. This is a flexible approach as you can use any Kubernetes PodSpecable object as an event source, such as Deployment, Job, or Knative services.

Verify the installation \u00b6 Monitor the Knative components until all of the components show a STATUS of Running or Completed : kubectl get pods --namespace knative-serving Configure DNS \u00b6 You can configure DNS to prevent the need to run curl commands with a host header. The tabs below expand to show instructions for configuring DNS. Follow the procedure for the DNS of your choice: Magic DNS (xip.io) We ship a simple Kubernetes Job called \"default domain\" that will (see caveats) configure Knative Serving to use xip.io as the default DNS suffix. kubectl apply -f http://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.20.0/serving-default-domain.yaml CAVEAT This will only work if the cluster LoadBalancer service exposes an IPv4 address or hostname, so it will not work with IPv6 clusters or local setups like Minikube. For these, see \"Real DNS\" or \"Temporary DNS\". Real DNS To configure DNS for Knative, take the External IP or CNAME from setting up networking, and configure it with your DNS provider as follows: If the networking layer produced an External IP address, then configure a wildcard A record for the domain: # Here knative.example.com is the domain suffix for your cluster *.knative.example.com == A 35 .233.41.212 If the networking layer produced a CNAME, then configure a CNAME record for the domain: # Here knative.example.com is the domain suffix for your cluster *.knative.example.com == CNAME a317a278525d111e89f272a164fd35fb-1510370581.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com Once your DNS provider has been configured, direct Knative to use that domain: # Replace knative.example.com with your domain suffix kubectl patch configmap/config-domain \\ --namespace knative-serving \\ --type merge \\ --patch '{\"data\":{\"knative.example.com\":\"\"}}' Temporary DNS Info If you are using curl to access the sample applications, or your own Knative app, and are unable to use the \"Magic DNS (xip.io)\" or \"Real DNS\" methods, there is a temporary approach. This is useful for those who wish to evaluate Knative without altering their DNS configuration, as per the \"Real DNS\" method, or cannot use the \"Magic DNS\" method due to using, for example, minikube locally or IPv6 clusters. To access your application using curl using this method: After starting your application, get the URL of your application: kubectl get ksvc Verify the output NAME URL LATESTCREATED LATESTREADY READY REASON helloworld-go http://helloworld-go.default.example.com helloworld-go-vqjlf helloworld-go-vqjlf True Instruct curl to connect to the External IP or CNAME defined by the networking layer in section 3 above, and use the -H \"Host:\" command-line option to specify the Knative application's host name. For example, if the networking layer defines your External IP and port to be http://192.168.39.228:32198 and you wish to access the above helloworld-go application, use: curl -H \"Host: helloworld-go.default.example.com\" http://192.168.39.228:32198 Verify the output In the case of the provided helloworld-go sample application, the output should, using the default configuration, be: Hello Go Sample v1! Refer to the \"Real DNS\" method for a permanent solution.

The tabs below expand to show instructions for configuring DNS. Follow the procedure for the DNS of your choice: Magic DNS (xip.io) We ship a simple Kubernetes Job called \"default domain\" that will (see caveats) configure Knative Serving to use xip.io as the default DNS suffix. kubectl apply -f http://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.20.0/serving-default-domain.yaml CAVEAT This will only work if the cluster LoadBalancer service exposes an IPv4 address or hostname, so it will not work with IPv6 clusters or local setups like Minikube. For these, see \"Real DNS\" or \"Temporary DNS\". Real DNS To configure DNS for Knative, take the External IP or CNAME from setting up networking, and configure it with your DNS provider as follows: If the networking layer produced an External IP address, then configure a wildcard A record for the domain: # Here knative.example.com is the domain suffix for your cluster *.knative.example.com == A 35 .233.41.212 If the networking layer produced a CNAME, then configure a CNAME record for the domain: # Here knative.example.com is the domain suffix for your cluster *.knative.example.com == CNAME a317a278525d111e89f272a164fd35fb-1510370581.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com Once your DNS provider has been configured, direct Knative to use that domain: # Replace knative.example.com with your domain suffix kubectl patch configmap/config-domain \\ --namespace knative-serving \\ --type merge \\ --patch '{\"data\":{\"knative.example.com\":\"\"}}' Temporary DNS Info If you are using curl to access the sample applications, or your own Knative app, and are unable to use the \"Magic DNS (xip.io)\" or \"Real DNS\" methods, there is a temporary approach. This is useful for those who wish to evaluate Knative without altering their DNS configuration, as per the \"Real DNS\" method, or cannot use the \"Magic DNS\" method due to using, for example, minikube locally or IPv6 clusters. To access your application using curl using this method: After starting your application, get the URL of your application: kubectl get ksvc Verify the output NAME URL LATESTCREATED LATESTREADY READY REASON helloworld-go http://helloworld-go.default.example.com helloworld-go-vqjlf helloworld-go-vqjlf True Instruct curl to connect to the External IP or CNAME defined by the networking layer in section 3 above, and use the -H \"Host:\" command-line option to specify the Knative application's host name. For example, if the networking layer defines your External IP and port to be http://192.168.39.228:32198 and you wish to access the above helloworld-go application, use: curl -H \"Host: helloworld-go.default.example.com\" http://192.168.39.228:32198 Verify the output In the case of the provided helloworld-go sample application, the output should, using the default configuration, be: Hello Go Sample v1!

If your cloud platform offers a managed Istio installation, we recommend installing Istio that way, unless you need to customize your installation. Before you begin \u00b6 You need: A Kubernetes cluster created. istioctl (v1.7 or later) installed. Supported Istio versions \u00b6 The current known-to-be-stable version of Istio tested in conjunction with Knative is v1.8.2 . Versions in the 1.7 line are generally fine too. 1.8.0 and 1.8.1 have bugs that don't work with Knative. Installing Istio \u00b6 When you install Istio, there are a few options depending on your goals. For a basic Istio installation suitable for most Knative use cases, follow the Installing Istio without sidecar injection instructions. If you're familiar with Istio and know what kind of installation you want, read through the options and choose the installation that suits your needs. You can easily customize your Istio installation with istioctl . The below sections cover a few useful Istio configurations and their benefits. Choosing an Istio installation \u00b6 You can install Istio with or without a service mesh: Installing Istio without sidecar injection (Recommended default installation) Installing Istio with sidecar injection If you want to get up and running with Knative quickly, we recommend installing Istio without automatic sidecar injection. This install is also recommended for users who don't need the Istio service mesh, or who want to enable the service mesh by manually injecting the Istio sidecars . Installing Istio without sidecar injection \u00b6 Enter the following command to install Istio: cat << EOF > ./istio-minimal-operator.yaml apiVersion: install.istio.io/v1alpha1 kind: IstioOperator spec: values: global: proxy: autoInject: disabled useMCP: false # The third-party-jwt is not enabled on all k8s. # See: https://istio.io/docs/ops/best-practices/security/#configure-third-party-service-account-tokens jwtPolicy: first-party-jwt addonComponents: pilot: enabled: true components: ingressGateways: - name: istio-ingressgateway enabled: true EOF istioctl install -f istio-minimal-operator.yaml Installing Istio with sidecar injection \u00b6 If you want to enable the Istio service mesh, you must enable automatic sidecar injection . The Istio service mesh provides a few benefits: Allows you to turn on mutual TLS , which secures service-to-service traffic within the cluster. Allows you to use the Istio authorization policy , controlling the access to each Knative service based on Istio service roles. To automatic sidecar injection, set autoInject: enabled in addition to above operator configuration. global: proxy: autoInject: enabled Using Istio mTLS feature \u00b6 Since there are some networking communications between knative-serving namespace and the namespace where your services running on, you need additional preparations for mTLS enabled environment. Enable sidecar container on knative-serving system namespace. kubectl label namespace knative-serving istio-injection = enabled Set PeerAuthentication to PERMISSIVE on knative-serving system namespace. cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: \"security.istio.io/v1beta1\" kind: \"PeerAuthentication\" metadata: name: \"default\" namespace: \"knative-serving\" spec: mtls: mode: PERMISSIVE EOF After you install the cluster local gateway, your service and deployment for the local gateway is named knative-local-gateway . Updating the config-istio configmap to use a non-default local gateway \u00b6 If you create a custom service and deployment for local gateway with a name other than knative-local-gateway , you need to update gateway configmap config-istio under the knative-serving namespace. Edit the config-istio configmap: kubectl edit configmap config-istio -n knative-serving Replace the local-gateway.knative-serving.knative-local-gateway field with the custom service. As an example, if you name both the service and deployment custom-local-gateway under the namespace istio-system , it should be updated to: custom-local-gateway.istio-system.svc.cluster.local As an example, if both the custom service and deployment are labeled with custom: custom-local-gateway , not the default istio: knative-local-gateway , you must update gateway instance knative-local-gateway in the knative-serving namespace: kubectl edit gateway knative-local-gateway -n knative-serving Replace the label selector with the label of your service: istio: knative-local-gateway For the service above, it should be updated to: custom: custom-local-gateway If there is a change in service ports (compared to that of knative-local-gateway ), update the port info in the gateway accordingly. Verifying your Istio install \u00b6 View the status of your Istio installation to make sure the install was successful. It might take a few seconds, so rerun the following command until all of the pods show a STATUS of Running or Completed : kubectl get pods --namespace istio-system Tip: You can append the --watch flag to the kubectl get commands to view the pod status in realtime. You use CTRL + C to exit watch mode. Configuring DNS \u00b6 Knative dispatches to different services based on their hostname, so it is recommended to have DNS properly configured. To do this, begin by looking up the external IP address that Istio received: $ kubectl get svc -nistio-system NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE istio-ingressgateway LoadBalancer 10.0.2.24 34.83.80.117 15020:32206/TCP,80:30742/TCP,443:30996/TCP 2m14s istio-pilot ClusterIP 10.0.3.27 <none> 15010/TCP,15011/TCP,8080/TCP,15014/TCP 2m14s This external IP can be used with your DNS provider with a wildcard A record. However, for a basic non-production set up, this external IP address can be used with xip.io in the config-domain ConfigMap in knative-serving . You can edit this by using the following command: kubectl edit cm config-domain --namespace knative-serving Given the external IP above, change the content to: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: config-domain namespace: knative-serving data: # xip.io is a \"magic\" DNS provider, which resolves all DNS lookups for: # *.{ip}.xip.io to {ip}. 34.83.80.117.xip.io: \"\" Istio resources \u00b6 For the official Istio installation guide, see the Istio Kubernetes Getting Started Guide .

If Knative Serving launches a new version, e.g. $spec_version , you can install it by applying a YAML file containing the following: apiVersion: v1 kind: Namespace metadata: name: knative-serving --- apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind: KnativeServing metadata: name: knative-serving namespace: knative-serving spec: version: $spec_version manifests: - URL: https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v${VERSION}/serving-core.yaml - URL: https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v${VERSION}/serving-hpa.yaml - URL: https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v${VERSION}/serving-post-install-jobs.yaml - URL: https://github.com/knative/net-istio/releases/download/v${VERSION}/net-istio.yaml The field $spec_version is used to set the version of Knative Serving. Replace $spec_version with the correct version number. The tag ${VERSION} is automatically replaced with the version number from spec_version by the operator. The field spec.manifests is used to specify one or multiple URL links of Knative Serving component. Do not forget to add the valid URL of the Knative network ingress plugin. Knative Serving component is still tightly-coupled with a network ingress plugin in the operator. As in the above example, you can use net-istio . The ordering of the URLs is critical. Put the manifest you want to apply first on the top. Install Customized Knative Serving The operator provides you the flexibility to install customized Knative Serving based your own requirements. As long as the manifests of customized Knative Serving are accessible to the operator, they can be installed. There are two modes available for you to install the customized manifests: overwrite mode and append mode. With the overwrite mode, you need to define all the manifests for Knative Serving to install, because the operator will no long install any available default manifests. With the append mode, you only need to define your customized manifests, and the customized manifests are installed, after default manifests are applied. You can use the overwrite mode to customize all the Knative Serving manifests. For example, the version of the customized Knative Serving is $spec_version , and it is available at https://my-serving/serving.yaml . You choose net-istio as the ingress plugin, which is available at https://my-net-istio/net-istio.yaml . You can create the content of Serving CR as below to install your Knative Serving and the istio ingress: apiVersion: v1 kind: Namespace metadata: name: knative-serving --- apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind: KnativeServing metadata: name: knative-serving namespace: knative-serving spec: version: $spec_version manifests: - URL: https://my-serving/serving.yaml - URL: https://my-net-istio/net-istio.yaml You can make the customized Knative Serving available in one or multiple links, as the spec.manifests supports a list of links. The ordering of the URLs is critical. Put the manifest you want to apply first on the top. We strongly recommend you to specify the version and the valid links to the customized Knative Serving, by leveraging both spec_version and spec.manifests . Do not skip either field. You can use the append mode to add your customized manifests into the default manifests. For example, you only customize a few resources, and make them available at https://my-serving/serving-custom.yaml . You still need to install the default Knative Serving. In this case, you can create the content of Serving CR as below: apiVersion: v1 kind: Namespace metadata: name: knative-serving --- apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind: KnativeServing metadata: name: knative-serving namespace: knative-serving spec: version: $spec_version additionalManifests: - URL: https://my-serving/serving-custom.yaml Knative operator will install the default manifests of Knative Serving at the version $spec_version , and then install your customized manifests based on them. Verify the Knative Serving deployment: \u00b6 ``` kubectl get deployment -n knative-serving ``` If Knative Serving has been successfully deployed, all deployments of the Knative Serving will show `READY` status. Here is a sample output: ``` NAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE activator 1/1 1 1 18s autoscaler 1/1 1 1 18s autoscaler-hpa 1/1 1 1 14s controller 1/1 1 1 18s istio-webhook 1/1 1 1 12s networking-istio 1/1 1 1 12s webhook 1/1 1 1 17s ``` 3. Check the status of Knative Serving Custom Resource: ``` kubectl get KnativeServing knative-serving -n knative-serving ``` If Knative Serving is successfully installed, you should see: ``` NAME VERSION READY REASON knative-serving <version number> True ``` Installing with Different Networking Layers \u00b6 Installing the Knative Serving component with different network layers Knative Operator can configure Knative Serving component with different network layer options. Istio is the default network layer, if the ingress is not specified in the Knative Serving CR. Click on each tab below to see how you can configure Knative Serving with different ingresses: Ambassador The following commands install Ambassador and enable its Knative integration. Create a namespace to install Ambassador in: kubectl create namespace ambassador Install Ambassador: kubectl apply --namespace ambassador \\ --filename https://getambassador.io/yaml/ambassador/ambassador-crds.yaml \\ --filename https://getambassador.io/yaml/ambassador/ambassador-rbac.yaml \\ --filename https://getambassador.io/yaml/ambassador/ambassador-service.yaml Give Ambassador the required permissions: kubectl patch clusterrolebinding ambassador -p '{\"subjects\":[{\"kind\": \"ServiceAccount\", \"name\": \"ambassador\", \"namespace\": \"ambassador\"}]}' Enable Knative support in Ambassador: kubectl set env --namespace ambassador deployments/ambassador AMBASSADOR_KNATIVE_SUPPORT = true To configure Knative Serving to use Ambassador, apply the content of the Serving CR as below: cat <<-EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind: KnativeServing metadata: name: knative-serving namespace: knative-serving spec: config: network: ingress.class: \"ambassador.ingress.networking.knative.dev\" EOF Fetch the External IP or CNAME: kubectl --namespace ambassador get service ambassador Save this for configuring DNS below.

Gloo For a detailed guide on Gloo integration, see Installing Gloo for Knative in the Gloo documentation. The following commands install Gloo and enable its Knative integration. Make sure glooctl is installed (version 1.3.x and higher recommended): glooctl version If it is not installed, you can install the latest version using: curl -sL https://run.solo.io/gloo/install | sh export PATH = $HOME /.gloo/bin: $PATH Or following the Gloo CLI install instructions . Install Gloo and the Knative integration: glooctl install knative --install-knative = false To configure Knative Serving to use Gloo, apply the content of the Serving CR as below: cat <<-EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind: KnativeServing metadata: name: knative-serving namespace: knative-serving EOF There is no need to configure the ingress class to use the gloo. Fetch the External IP or CNAME: glooctl proxy url --name knative-external-proxy Save this for configuring DNS below. Kong The following commands install Kong and enable its Knative integration. Install Kong Ingress Controller: kubectl apply --filename https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/0.9.x/deploy/single/all-in-one-dbless.yaml To configure Knative Serving to use Kong, apply the content of the Serving CR as below: cat <<-EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind: KnativeServing metadata: name: knative-serving namespace: knative-serving spec: config: network: ingress.class: \"kong\" EOF Fetch the External IP or CNAME: kubectl --namespace kong get service kong-proxy Save this for configuring DNS below. Kourier The following commands install Kourier and enable its Knative integration. To configure Knative Serving to use Kourier, apply the content of the Serving CR as below: cat <<-EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind: KnativeServing metadata: name: knative-serving namespace: knative-serving spec: ingress: kourier: enabled: true config: network: ingress.class: \"kourier.ingress.networking.knative.dev\" EOF Fetch the External IP or CNAME: kubectl --namespace knative-serving get service kourier Save this for configuring DNS below. Configure DNS \u00b6 Magic DNS (xip.io) We ship a simple Kubernetes Job called \"default domain\" that will (see caveats) configure Knative Serving to use xip.io as the default DNS suffix. kubectl apply --filename http://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/ { 'provider' : 'mike' } /serving-default-domain.yaml Caveat : This will only work if the cluster LoadBalancer service exposes an IPv4 address or hostname, so it will not work with IPv6 clusters or local setups like Minikube. For these, see \"Real DNS\" or \"Temporary DNS\". Real DNS To configure DNS for Knative, take the External IP or CNAME from setting up networking, and configure it with your DNS provider as follows: If the networking layer produced an External IP address, then configure a wildcard A record for the domain: # Here knative.example.com is the domain suffix for your cluster *.knative.example.com == A 35.233.41.212 If the networking layer produced a CNAME, then configure a CNAME record for the domain: # Here knative.example.com is the domain suffix for your cluster *.knative.example.com == CNAME a317a278525d111e89f272a164fd35fb-1510370581.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com Once your DNS provider has been configured, add the following section into your existing Serving CR, and apply it: # Replace knative.example.com with your domain suffix apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind: KnativeServing metadata: name: knative-serving namespace: knative-serving spec: config: domain: \"knative.example.com\" : \"\" ... Temporary DNS If you are using curl to access the sample applications, or your own Knative app, and are unable to use the \"Magic DNS (xip.io)\" or \"Real DNS\" methods, there is a temporary approach. This is useful for those who wish to evaluate Knative without altering their DNS configuration, as per the \"Real DNS\" method, or cannot use the \"Magic DNS\" method due to using, for example, minikube locally or IPv6 clusters. To access your application using curl using this method: After starting your application, get the URL of your application: kubectl get ksvc The output should be similar to: NAME URL LATESTCREATED LATESTREADY READY REASON helloworld-go http://helloworld-go.default.example.com helloworld-go-vqjlf helloworld-go-vqjlf True Instruct curl to connect to the External IP or CNAME defined by the networking layer in section 3 above, and use the -H \"Host:\" command-line option to specify the Knative application's host name. For example, if the networking layer defines your External IP and port to be http://192.168.39.228:32198 and you wish to access the above helloworld-go application, use: curl -H \"Host: helloworld-go.default.example.com\" http://192.168.39.228:32198 In the case of the provided helloworld-go sample application, using the default configuration, the output should be: Hello Go Sample v1! Refer to the \"Real DNS\" method for a permanent solution. Monitor the Knative components until all of the components show a STATUS of Running or Completed : kubectl get pods --namespace knative-serving Installing the Knative Eventing component \u00b6 Create and apply the Knative Eventing CR: You can install the latest available Knative Eventing in the operator by applying a YAML file containing the following: Install Current Evenintg (default) apiVersion: v1 kind: Namespace metadata: name: knative-eventing --- apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind: KnativeEventing metadata: name: knative-eventing namespace: knative-eventing If you do not specify a version by using spec.version, the operator defaults to the latest available version. Install Future Knative Eventing You do not need to upgrade the operator to a newer version to install new releases of Knative Eventing. If Knative Eventing launches a new version, e.g. $spec_version , you can install it by applying a YAML file containing the following: apiVersion: v1 kind: Namespace metadata: name: knative-eventing --- apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind: KnativeEventing metadata: name: knative-eventing namespace: knative-eventing spec: version: $spec_version manifests: - URL: https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases/download/v${VERSION}/eventing.yaml - URL: https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases/download/v${VERSION}/eventing-post-install-jobs.yaml The field spec.version is used to set the version of Knative Eventing. Replace $spec_version with the correct version number. The tag ${VERSION} is automatically replaced with the version number from spec.version by the operator.

Real DNS To configure DNS for Knative, take the External IP or CNAME from setting up networking, and configure it with your DNS provider as follows: If the networking layer produced an External IP address, then configure a wildcard A record for the domain: # Here knative.example.com is the domain suffix for your cluster *.knative.example.com == A 35.233.41.212 If the networking layer produced a CNAME, then configure a CNAME record for the domain: # Here knative.example.com is the domain suffix for your cluster *.knative.example.com == CNAME a317a278525d111e89f272a164fd35fb-1510370581.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com Once your DNS provider has been configured, add the following section into your existing Serving CR, and apply it: # Replace knative.example.com with your domain suffix apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind: KnativeServing metadata: name: knative-serving namespace: knative-serving spec: config: domain: \"knative.example.com\" : \"\" ... Temporary DNS If you are using curl to access the sample applications, or your own Knative app, and are unable to use the \"Magic DNS (xip.io)\" or \"Real DNS\" methods, there is a temporary approach. This is useful for those who wish to evaluate Knative without altering their DNS configuration, as per the \"Real DNS\" method, or cannot use the \"Magic DNS\" method due to using, for example, minikube locally or IPv6 clusters. To access your application using curl using this method: After starting your application, get the URL of your application: kubectl get ksvc The output should be similar to: NAME URL LATESTCREATED LATESTREADY READY REASON helloworld-go http://helloworld-go.default.example.com helloworld-go-vqjlf helloworld-go-vqjlf True Instruct curl to connect to the External IP or CNAME defined by the networking layer in section 3 above, and use the -H \"Host:\" command-line option to specify the Knative application's host name. For example, if the networking layer defines your External IP and port to be http://192.168.39.228:32198 and you wish to access the above helloworld-go application, use: curl -H \"Host: helloworld-go.default.example.com\" http://192.168.39.228:32198 In the case of the provided helloworld-go sample application, using the default configuration, the output should be: Hello Go Sample v1!

Install Future Knative Eventing You do not need to upgrade the operator to a newer version to install new releases of Knative Eventing. If Knative Eventing launches a new version, e.g. $spec_version , you can install it by applying a YAML file containing the following: apiVersion: v1 kind: Namespace metadata: name: knative-eventing --- apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind: KnativeEventing metadata: name: knative-eventing namespace: knative-eventing spec: version: $spec_version manifests: - URL: https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases/download/v${VERSION}/eventing.yaml - URL: https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases/download/v${VERSION}/eventing-post-install-jobs.yaml The field spec.version is used to set the version of Knative Eventing. Replace $spec_version with the correct version number. The tag ${VERSION} is automatically replaced with the version number from spec.version by the operator. The field spec.manifests is used to specify one or multiple URL links of Knative Eventing component. Do not forget to add the valid URL of the Knative network ingress plugin. The ordering of the URLs is critical. Put the manifest you want to apply first on the top. Install Customized Knative Evening The operator provides you the flexibility to install customized Knative Eventing based your own requirements. As long as the manifests of customized Knative Eventing are accessible to the operator, they can be installed. There are two modes available for you to install the customized manifests: overwrite mode and append mode. With the overwrite mode, you need to define all the manifests for Knative Eventing to install, because the operator will no long install any available default manifests. With the append mode, you only need to define your customized manifests, and the customized manifests are installed, after default manifests are applied. You can use the overwrite mode to customize all the Knative Eventing manifests. For example, the version of the customized Knative Eventing is $spec_version , and it is available at https://my-eventing/eventing.yaml . You can create the content of Eventing CR as below to install your Knative Eventing: apiVersion: v1 kind: Namespace metadata: name: knative-eventing --- apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind: KnativeEventing metadata: name: knative-eventing namespace: knative-eventing spec: version: $spec_version manifests: - URL: https://my-eventing/eventing.yaml You can make the customized Knative Eventing available in one or multiple links, as the spec.manifests supports a list of links. The ordering of the URLs is critical. Put the manifest you want to apply first on the top. We strongly recommend you to specify the version and the valid links to the customized Knative Eventing, by leveraging both spec.version and spec.manifests . Do not skip either field. You can use the append mode to add your customized manifests into the default manifests. For example, you only customize a few resources, and make them available at https://my-eventing/eventing-custom.yaml . You still need to install the default Knative eventing. In this case, you can create the content of Eventing CR as below: apiVersion: v1 kind: Namespace metadata: name: knative-eventing --- apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind: KnativeEventing metadata: name: knative-eventing namespace: knative-eventing spec: version: $spec_version additionalManifests: - URL: https://my-eventing/eventing-custom.yaml Knative operator will install the default manifests of Knative Eventing at the version $spec_version , and then install your customized manifests based on them.","title":"Installing the Knative Eventing component"},{"location":"install/knative-with-operators/#verify-the-knative-eventing-deployment","text":"kubectl get deployment -n knative-eventing If Knative Eventing has been successfully deployed, all deployments of the Knative Eventing will show READY status.

It supports upgrading the Knative component by a single minor version number. For example, if you have v0.17 installed, you must upgrade to v0.18 before attempting to upgrade to v0.19. The attribute spec.version is the only field you need to change in the Serving or Eventing CR to perform an upgrade. You do not need to specify the version in terms of the patch number, because the Knative Operator will match the latest available patch number, as long as you specify major.minor for the version. For example, you only need to specify 0.19 to upgrade to the latest v0.19 release. There is no need to know the exact patch number. The Knative Operator implements a minus 3 principle to support the Knative versions, which means the current version of the Operator can support Knative with the version back 3 in terms of the minor number. For example, if the current version of the Operator is 0.19.x, it bundles and supports the installation of Knative with the versions, 0.16.x, 0.17.x, 0.18.x and 0.19.x.

This is not required for running Knative, but can be helpful with Knative Serving , which will automatically delete pods (and their associated logs) when they are no longer needed. Note that Fluent Bit supports exporting to a number of other log providers; if you already have an existing log provider (for example, Splunk, Datadog, ElasticSearch, or Stackdriver), then you may only need the second part of setting up and configuring log forwarders . Setting up log collection consists of two pieces: running a log forwarding DaemonSet on each node, and running a collector somewhere in the cluster (in our example, we use a StatefulSet which stores logs on a Kubernetes PersistentVolumeClaim, but you could also use a HostPath). Setting up the collector \u00b6 It's useful to set up the collector before the forwarders, because you'll need the address of the collector when configuring the forwarders, and the forwarders may queue logs until the collector is ready. The fluent-bit-collector.yaml defines a StatefulSet as well as a Kubernetes Service which allows accessing and reading the logs from within the cluster. The supplied configuration will create the monitoring configuration in a namespace called logging . You can apply the configuration with: kubectl apply --filename https://github.com/knative/docs/raw/main/docs/install/collecting-logs/fluent-bit-collector.yaml The default configuration will classify logs into Knative, apps (pods with an app= label which aren't Knative), and the default to logging with the pod name; this can be changed by updating the log-collector-config ConfigMap before or after installation. Once the ConfigMap is updated, you'll need to restart Fluent Bit (for example, by deleting the pod and letting the StatefulSet recreate it). To access the logs through your web browser: kubectl port-forward --namespace logging service/log-collector 8080 :80 And then visit http://localhost:8080/. You can also open a shell in the nginx pod and search the logs using unix tools: kubectl exec --namespace logging --stdin --tty --container nginx log-collector-0 Setting up the forwarders \u00b6 For the most part, you can follow the Fluent Bit directions for installing on Kubernetes .

OpenTelemetry is a CNCF an observability framework for cloud-native software. The project provides a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs. You use it to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) for analysis in order to understand your software's performance and behavior. OpenTelemetry allows Knative to build provider-agnostic instrumentation into the platform, so that it's easy to export metrics to multiple monitoring services without needing to rebuild or reconfigure the Knative binaries. Setting up the collector \u00b6 The collector provides a long-lived location where various Knative components can push metrics (and eventually traces) to be retained and collected by a monitoring service. For this example, we'll configure a single collector instance using a ConfigMap and a Deployment. For more complex deployments, some of this can be automated using the opentelemetry-operator , but it's also easy to manage this service directly. Note that you can attach other components (node agents, other services); this is just a simple sample. First, create a namespace for the collector to run in: kubectl create namespace metrics And then create a Deployment, Service, and ConfigMap for the collector: kubectl apply --filename https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knative/docs/master/docs/install/collecting-metrics/collector.yaml Finally, update the config-observability ConfigMap in Knative Serving and Eventing kubectl patch --namespace knative-serving configmap/config-observability \\ --type merge \\ --patch '{\"data\":{\"metrics.backend-destination\":\"opencensus\",\"request-metrics-backend-destination\":\"opencensus\",\"metrics.opencensus-address\":\"otel-collector.metrics:55678\"}}' kubectl patch --namespace knative-eventing configmap/config-observability \\ --type merge \\ --patch '{\"data\":{\"metrics.backend-destination\":\"opencensus\",\"metrics.opencensus-address\":\"otel-collector.metrics:55678\"}}' You can check that metrics are being forwarded by loading the Prometheus export port on the collector: kubectl port-forward --namespace metrics deployment/otel-collector 8889 And then fetch http://localhost:8889/metrics to see the exported metrics.

NOTE: Kubernetes spec level policies cannot be configured using the Knative Operators. Installing a specific version of Eventing \u00b6 Cluster administrators can install a specific version of Knative Eventing by using the spec.version field. For example, if you want to install Knative Eventing v0.19.0, you can apply the following KnativeEventing CR: apiVersion : operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind : KnativeEventing metadata : name : knative-eventing namespace : knative-eventing spec : version : 0.19.0 If spec.version is not specified, the Knative Operator will install the latest available version of Knative Eventing. If users specify an invalid or unavailable version, the Knative Operator will do nothing. The Knative Operator always includes the latest 3 minor release versions. If Knative Eventing is already managed by the Operator, updating the spec.version field in the KnativeEventing CR enables upgrading or downgrading the Knative Eventing version, without requiring modifications to the Operator. Note that the Knative Operator only permits upgrades or downgrades by one minor release version at a time. For example, if the current Knative Eventing deployment is version 0.18.x, you must upgrade to 0.19.x before upgrading to 0.20.x. Configuring Knative Eventing using ConfigMaps \u00b6 The Operator manages the Knative Eventing installation. It overwrites any updates to ConfigMaps which are used to configure Knative Eventing. The KnativeEventing CR allows you to set values for these ConfigMaps by using the Operator. All Knative Eventing ConfigMaps are created in the same namespace as the KnativeEventing CR. You can use the KnativeEventing CR as a unique entry point to edit all ConfigMaps. Knative Eventing has multiple ConfigMaps that are named with the prefix config- . The spec.config in the KnativeEventing CR has one <name> entry for each ConfigMap, named config-<name> , with a value which will be used for the ConfigMap data . Setting a default channel \u00b6 If you are using different channel implementations, like the KafkaChannel, or you want a specific configuration of the InMemoryChannel to be the default configuration, you can change the default behavior by updating the default-ch-webhook ConfigMap. You can do this by modifying the KnativeEventing CR: apiVersion : operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind : KnativeEventing metadata : name : knative-eventing namespace : knative-eventing spec : config : default-ch-webhook : default-ch-config : | clusterDefault: apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1beta1 kind: KafkaChannel spec: numPartitions: 10 replicationFactor: 1 namespaceDefaults: my-namespace: apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1 kind: InMemoryChannel spec: delivery: backoffDelay: PT0.5S backoffPolicy: exponential retry: 5 NOTE: The clusterDefault setting determines the global, cluster-wide default channel type. You can configure channel defaults for individual namespaces by using the namespaceDefaults setting. Setting the default channel for the broker \u00b6 If you are using a channel-based broker, you can change the default channel type for the broker from InMemoryChannel to KafkaChannel, by updating the config-br-default-channel ConfigMap. You can do this by modifying the KnativeEventing CR: apiVersion : operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind : KnativeEventing metadata : name : knative-eventing namespace : knative-eventing spec : config : config-br-default-channel : channelTemplateSpec : | apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1beta1 kind: KafkaChannel spec: numPartitions: 6 replicationFactor: 1 Private repository and private secrets \u00b6 The Knative Eventing Operator CR is configured the same way as the Knative Serving Operator CR. See the documentation on Private repository and private secret . Knative Eventing also specifies only one container within each Deployment resource. However, the container does not use the same name as its parent Deployment, which means that the container name in Knative Eventing is not the same unique identifier as it is in Knative Serving. List of containers within each Deployment resource: Component Deployment name Container name Core eventing eventing-controller eventing-controller Core eventing eventing-webhook eventing-webhook Eventing Broker broker-controller eventing-controller In-Memory Channel imc-controller controller In-Memory Channel imc-dispatcher dispatcher The default field can still be used to replace the images in a predefined format. However, if the container name is not a unique identifier, for example eventing-controller , you must use the override field to replace it, by specifying deployment/container as the unique key. Some images are defined by using the environment variable in Knative Eventing. They can be replaced by taking advantage of the override field. Download images in a predefined format without secrets \u00b6 This example shows how you can define custom image links that can be defined in the KnativeEventing CR using the simplified format docker.io/knative-images/${NAME}:{CUSTOM-TAG} . In the example below: The custom tag latest is used for all images. All image links are accessible without using secrets. Images are defined in the accepted format docker.io/knative-images/${NAME}:{CUSTOM-TAG} . Push images to the following image tags: Deployment Container Docker image eventing-controller eventing-controller docker.io/knative-images/eventing-controller:latest eventing-webhook docker.io/knative-images/eventing-webhook:latest broker-controller eventing-controller docker.io/knative-images/broker-eventing-controller:latest controller docker.io/knative-images/controller:latest dispatcher docker.io/knative-images/dispatcher:latest Define your the KnativeEventing CR with following content: apiVersion : operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind : KnativeEventing metadata : name : knative-eventing namespace : knative-eventing spec : registry : default : docker.io/knative-images/${NAME}:latest override : broker-controller/eventing-controller : docker.io/knative-images-repo1/broker-eventing-controller:latest - `${NAME}` maps to the container name in each `Deployment` resource. - `default` is used to define the image format for all containers, except the container `eventing-controller` in the deployment `broker-controller`. To replace the image for this container, use the `override` field to specify individually, by using `broker-controller/eventing-controller` as the key. Download images from different repositories without secrets \u00b6 If your custom image links are not defined in a uniform format, you will need to individually include each link in the KnativeEventing CR. For example, to define the following list of images: Deployment Container Docker Image eventing-controller eventing-controller docker.io/knative-images/eventing-controller:latest eventing-webhook docker.io/knative-images/eventing-webhook:latest controller docker.io/knative-images/controller:latest dispatcher docker.io/knative-images/dispatcher:latest broker-controller eventing-controller docker.io/knative-images/broker-eventing-controller:latest The KnativeEventing CR must be modified to include the full list. For example: apiVersion : operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind : KnativeEventing metadata : name : knative-eventing namespace : knative-eventing spec : registry : override : eventing-controller/eventing-controller : docker.io/knative-images-repo1/eventing-controller:latest eventing-webhook/eventing-webhook : docker.io/knative-images-repo2/eventing-webhook:latest imc-controller/controller : docker.io/knative-images-repo3/imc-controller:latest imc-dispatcher/dispatcher : docker.io/knative-images-repo4/imc-dispatcher:latest broker-controller/eventing-controller : docker.io/knative-images-repo5/broker-eventing-controller:latest If you want to replace the image defined by the environment variable, you must modify the KnativeEventing CR. For example, if you want to replace the image defined by the environment variable DISPATCHER_IMAGE , in the container controller , of the deployment imc-controller , and the target image is docker.io/knative-images-repo5/DISPATCHER_IMAGE:latest , the KnativeEventing CR would be as follows: apiVersion : operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind : KnativeEventing metadata : name : knative-eventing namespace : knative-eventing spec : registry : override : eventing-controller/eventing-controller : docker.io/knative-images-repo1/eventing-controller:latest eventing-webhook/eventing-webhook : docker.io/knative-images-repo2/eventing-webhook:latest imc-controller/controller : docker.io/knative-images-repo3/imc-controller:latest imc-dispatcher/dispatcher : docker.io/knative-images-repo4/imc-dispatcher:latest broker-controller/eventing-controller : docker.io/knative-images-repo5/broker-eventing-controller:latest DISPATCHER_IMAGE : docker.io/knative-images-repo5/DISPATCHER_IMAGE:latest Download images with secrets \u00b6 If your image repository requires private secrets for access, you must append the imagePullSecrets attribute to the KnativeEventing CR. This example uses a secret named regcred . Refer to the Kubernetes documentation to create your own private secrets. After you create the secret, edit the KnativeEventing CR: apiVersion : operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind : KnativeEventing metadata : name : knative-eventing namespace : knative-eventing spec : registry : ... imagePullSecrets : - name : regcred The field imagePullSecrets requires a list of secrets. You can add multiple secrets to access the images: apiVersion : operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind : KnativeEventing metadata : name : knative-eventing namespace : knative-eventing spec : registry : ... imagePullSecrets : - name : regcred - name : regcred-2 ... Configuring the default broker class \u00b6 Knative Eventing allows you to define a default broker class when the user does not specify one. The Operator provides two broker classes by default: ChannelBasedBroker and MTChannelBasedBroker. The field defaultBrokerClass indicates which class to use; if empty, the ChannelBasedBroker is used. The following example CR specifies MTChannelBasedBroker as the default: apiVersion : operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind : KnativeEventing metadata : name : knative-eventing namespace : knative-eventing spec : defaultBrokerClass : MTChannelBasedBroker System resource settings \u00b6 The KnativeEventing CR allows you to configure system resources for Knative system containers. Requests and limits can be configured for the following containers: eventing-controller eventing-webhook imc-controller imc-dispatcher mt-broker-ingress mt-broker-ingress mt-broker-controller To override resource settings for a specific container, you must create an entry in the spec.resources list with the container name and the Kubernetes resource settings . For example, the following KnativeEventing CR configures the eventing-webhook container to request 0.3 CPU and 100MB of RAM, and sets hard limits of 1 CPU, 250MB RAM, and 4GB of local storage: apiVersion : operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind : KnativeEventing metadata : name : knative-eventing namespace : knative-eventing spec : resources : - container : eventing-webhook requests : cpu : 300m memory : 100Mi limits : cpu : 1000m memory : 250Mi","title":"Configuring the Eventing Operator custom resource"},{"location":"install/operator/configuring-eventing-cr/#installing-a-specific-version-of-eventing","text":"Cluster administrators can install a specific version of Knative Eventing by using the spec.version field.

For example, the following KnativeEventing CR configures the eventing-webhook container to request 0.3 CPU and 100MB of RAM, and sets hard limits of 1 CPU, 250MB RAM, and 4GB of local storage: apiVersion : operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind : KnativeEventing metadata : name : knative-eventing namespace : knative-eventing spec : resources : - container : eventing-webhook requests : cpu : 300m memory : 100Mi limits : cpu : 1000m memory : 250Mi","title":"System resource settings"},{"location":"install/operator/configuring-serving-cr/","text":"The Knative Serving operator can be configured with these options: Version Configuration Serving Configuration by ConfigMap Private repository and private secret SSL certificate for controller Knative ingress gateway Cluster local gateway High availability System Resource Settings Override system deployments Version Configuration \u00b6 Cluster administrators can install a specific version of Knative Serving by using the spec.version field. For example, if you want to install Knative Serving 0.16.0, you can apply the following KnativeServing custom resource: apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind: KnativeServing metadata: name: knative-serving namespace: knative-serving spec: version: 0.16.0 If spec.version is not specified, the Knative Operator will install the latest available version of Knative Serving. If users specify an invalid or unavailable version, the Knative Operator will do nothing. The Knative Operator always includes the latest 3 minor release versions. For example, if the current version of the Knative Operator is 0.16.x, the earliest version of Knative Serving available through the Operator is 0.14.0. If Knative Serving is already managed by the Operator, updating the spec.version field in the KnativeServing resource enables upgrading or downgrading the Knative Serving version, without needing to change the Operator. Note that the Knative Operator only permits upgrades or downgrades by one minor release version at a time. For example, if the current Knative Serving deployment is version 0.14.x, you must upgrade to 0.15.x before upgrading to 0.16.x. Serving Configuration by ConfigMap \u00b6 The Operator manages the Knative Serving installation. It overwrites any updates to ConfigMaps which are used to configure Knative Serving. The KnativeServing custom resource (CR) allows you to set values for these ConfigMaps by using the Operator. Knative Serving has multiple ConfigMaps that are named with the prefix config- . The spec.config in the KnativeServing CR has one <name> entry for each ConfigMap, named config-<name> , with a value which will be used for the ConfigMap data . In the setup a custom domain example , you can see the content of the ConfigMap config-domain is: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: config-domain namespace: knative-serving data: example.org: | selector: app: prod example.com: \"\" Using the operator, specify the ConfigMap config-domain using the operator CR: apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind: KnativeServing metadata: name: knative-serving namespace: knative-serving spec: config: domain: example.org: | selector: app: prod example.com: \"\" You can apply values to multiple ConfigMaps. This example sets stable-window to 60s in config-autoscaler as well as specifying config-domain : apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind: KnativeServing metadata: name: knative-serving namespace: knative-serving spec: config: domain: example.org: | selector: app: prod example.com: \"\" autoscaler: stable-window: \"60s\" All the ConfigMaps are created in the same namespace as the operator CR. You can use the operator CR as the unique entry point to edit all of them. Private repository and private secrets \u00b6 You can use the spec.registry section of the operator CR to change the image references to point to a private registry or specify imagePullSecrets : default : this field defines a image reference template for all Knative images. The format is example-registry.io/custom/path/${NAME}:{CUSTOM-TAG} . If you use the same tag for all your images, the only difference is the image name. ${NAME} is a pre-defined variable in the operator corresponding to the container name. If you name the images in your private repo to align with the container names ( activator , autoscaler , controller , webhook , autoscaler-hpa , networking-istio , and queue-proxy ), the default argument should be sufficient. override : a map from container name to the full registry location. This section is only needed when the registry images do not match the common naming format. For containers whose name matches a key, the value is used in preference to the image name calculated by default . If a container's name does not match a key in override , the template in default is used. imagePullSecrets : a list of Secret names used when pulling Knative container images. The Secrets must be created in the same namespace as the Knative Serving Deployments. See deploying images from a private container registry for configuration details. Download images in a predefined format without secrets: \u00b6 This example shows how you can define custom image links that can be defined in the CR using the simplified format docker.io/knative-images/${NAME}:{CUSTOM-TAG} . In the example below: the custom tag v0.13.0 is used for all images all image links are accessible without using secrets images are pushed as docker.io/knative-images/${NAME}:{CUSTOM-TAG} First, you need to make sure your images pushed to the following image tags: Container Docker Image activator docker.io/knative-images/activator:v0.13.0 autoscaler docker.io/knative-images/autoscaler:v0.13.0 controller docker.io/knative-images/controller:v0.13.0 webhook docker.io/knative-images/webhook:v0.13.0 autoscaler-hpa docker.io/knative-images/autoscaler-hpa:v0.13.0 networking-istio docker.io/knative-images/networking-istio:v0.13.0 queue-proxy docker.io/knative-images/queue-proxy:v0.13.0 Then, you need to define your operator CR with following content: apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind: KnativeServing metadata: name: knative-serving namespace: knative-serving spec: registry: default: docker.io/knative-images/${NAME}:v0.13.0 Download images individually without secrets: \u00b6 If your custom image links are not defined in a uniform format by default, you will need to individually include each link in the CR. For example, to given the following images: Container Docker Image activator docker.io/knative-images-repo1/activator:v0.13.0 autoscaler docker.io/knative-images-repo2/autoscaler:v0.13.0 controller docker.io/knative-images-repo3/controller:v0.13.0 webhook docker.io/knative-images-repo4/webhook:v0.13.0 autoscaler-hpa docker.io/knative-images-repo5/autoscaler-hpa:v0.13.0 networking-istio docker.io/knative-images-repo6/prefix-networking-istio:v0.13.0 queue-proxy docker.io/knative-images-repo7/queue-proxy-suffix:v0.13.0 The operator CR should be modified to include the full list: apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind: KnativeServing metadata: name: knative-serving namespace: knative-serving spec: registry: override: activator: docker.io/knative-images-repo1/activator:v0.13.0 autoscaler: docker.io/knative-images-repo2/autoscaler:v0.13.0 controller: docker.io/knative-images-repo3/controller:v0.13.0 webhook: docker.io/knative-images-repo4/webhook:v0.13.0 autoscaler-hpa: docker.io/knative-images-repo5/autoscaler-hpa:v0.13.0 networking-istio: docker.io/knative-images-repo6/prefix-networking-istio:v0.13.0 queue-proxy: docker.io/knative-images-repo7/queue-proxy-suffix:v0.13.0 Download images with secrets: \u00b6 If your image repository requires private secrets for access, include the imagePullSecrets attribute. This example uses a secret named regcred . You must create your own private secrets if these are required: From existing docker credentials From command line for docker credentials Create your own secret After you create this secret, edit your operator CR by appending the content below: apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind: KnativeServing metadata: name: knative-serving namespace: knative-serving spec: registry: ... imagePullSecrets: - name: regcred The field imagePullSecrets expects a list of secrets. You can add multiple secrets to access the images as below: apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind: KnativeServing metadata: name: knative-serving namespace: knative-serving spec: registry: ... imagePullSecrets: - name: regcred - name: regcred-2 ... SSL certificate for controller \u00b6 To enable tag to digest resolution , the Knative Serving controller needs to access the container registry. To allow the controller to trust a self-signed registry cert, you can use the Operator to specify the certificate using a ConfigMap or Secret. Specify the following fields in spec.controller-custom-certs to select a custom registry certificate: name : the name of the ConfigMap or Secret. type : either the string \"ConfigMap\" or \"Secret\". If you create a ConfigMap named testCert containing the certificate, change your CR: apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind: KnativeServing metadata: name: knative-serving namespace: knative-serving spec: controller-custom-certs: name: testCert type: ConfigMap Configuration of Knative ingress gateway \u00b6 To set up custom ingress gateway, follow Step 1: Create Gateway Service and Deployment Instance . Step 2: Update the Knative gateway \u00b6 Update spec.ingress.istio.knative-ingress-gateway to select the labels of the new ingress gateway: apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind: KnativeServing metadata: name: knative-serving namespace: knative-serving spec: ingress: istio: enabled: true knative-ingress-gateway: selector: custom: ingressgateway Step 3: Update Gateway ConfigMap \u00b6 Additionally, you will need to update the Istio ConfigMap: apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind: KnativeServing metadata: name: knative-serving namespace: knative-serving spec: ingress: istio: enabled: true knative-ingress-gateway: selector: custom: ingressgateway config: istio: gateway.knative-serving.knative-ingress-gateway: \"custom-ingressgateway.istio-system.svc.cluster.local\" The key in spec.config.istio is in the format of gateway.. . Configuration of cluster local gateway \u00b6 Update spec.ingress.istio.knative-local-gateway to select the labels of the new cluster-local ingress gateway: Default local gateway name: \u00b6 Go through the guide here to use local cluster gateway, if you use the default gateway called knative-local-gateway . Non-default local gateway name: \u00b6 If you create custom local gateway with a name other than knative-local-gateway , update config.istio and the knative-local-gateway selector: This example shows a service and deployment knative-local-gateway in the namespace istio-system , with the label custom: custom-local-gw : apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind: KnativeServing metadata: name: knative-serving namespace: knative-serving spec: ingress: istio: enabled: true knative-local-gateway: selector: custom: custom-local-gateway config: istio: local-gateway.knative-serving.knative-local-gateway: \"custom-local-gateway.istio-system.svc.cluster.local\" High availability \u00b6 By default, Knative Serving runs a single instance of each controller. The spec.high-availability field allows you to configure the number of replicas for the following leader-elected controllers: controller , autoscaler-hpa , networking-istio . This field also configures the HorizontalPodAutoscaler resources for the data plane ( activator ): The following configuration specifies a replica count of 3 for the controllers and a minimum of 3 activators (which may scale higher if needed): apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind: KnativeServing metadata: name: knative-serving namespace: knative-serving spec: high-availability: replicas: 3 System Resource Settings \u00b6 The operator custom resource allows you to configure system resources for the Knative system containers. Requests and limits can be configured for the following containers: activator , autoscaler , controller , webhook , autoscaler-hpa , networking-istio and queue-proxy . To override resource settings for a specific container, create an entry in the spec.resources list with the container name and the Kubernetes resource settings . For example, the following KnativeServing resource configures the activator to request 0.3 CPU and 100MB of RAM, and sets hard limits of 1 CPU, 250MB RAM, and 4GB of local storage: apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind: KnativeServing metadata: name: knative-serving namespace: knative-serving spec: resources: - container: activator requests: cpu: 300m memory: 100Mi limits: cpu: 1000m memory: 250Mi ephemeral-storage: 4Gi If you would like to add another container autoscaler with the same configuration, you need to change your CR as below: apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind: KnativeServing metadata: name: knative-serving namespace: knative-serving spec: resources: - container: activator requests: cpu: 300m memory: 100Mi limits: cpu: 1000m memory: 250Mi ephemeral-storage: 4Gi - container: autoscaler requests: cpu: 300m memory: 100Mi limits: cpu: 1000m memory: 250Mi ephemeral-storage: 4Gi Override system deployments \u00b6 If you would like to override some configurations for a specific deployment, you can override the configuration by using spec.deployments in CR. Currently replicas , labels and annotations are supported. For example, the following KnativeServing resource overrides the webhook to have 3 replicass, mylabel: foo labels and myannotataions: bar annotations, while other system deployments have 2 replicas by spec.high-availability . apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1 kind: KnativeServing metadata: name: ks namespace: knative-serving spec: high-availability: replicas: 2 deployments: - name: webhook replicas: 3 labels: mylabel: foo annotations: myannotataions: bar NOTE: The labels and annotations settings override webhook's labels and annotations in deployment and pod both.","title":"Configuring the Serving Operator Custom Resource"},{"location":"install/operator/configuring-serving-cr/#version-configuration","text":"Cluster administrators can install a specific version of Knative Serving by using the spec.version field.

Resource Types: Configuration Revision Route Service Configuration Configuration represents the \u201cfloating HEAD\u201d of a linear history of Revisions. Users create new Revisions by updating the Configuration\u2019s spec. The \u201clatest created\u201d revision\u2019s name is available under status, as is the \u201clatest ready\u201d revision\u2019s name.

Defaults to 0 which means concurrency to the application is not limited, and the system decides the target concurrency for the autoscaler. timeoutSeconds int64 (Optional) TimeoutSeconds is the maximum duration in seconds that the request routing layer will wait for a request delivered to a container to begin replying (send network traffic). If unspecified, a system default will be provided. status RevisionStatus (Optional) Route Route is responsible for configuring ingress over a collection of Revisions. Some of the Revisions a Route distributes traffic over may be specified by referencing the Configuration responsible for creating them; in these cases the Route is additionally responsible for monitoring the Configuration for \u201clatest ready revision\u201d changes, and smoothly rolling out latest revisions.

Service Service acts as a top-level container that manages a Route and Configuration which implement a network service. Service exists to provide a singular abstraction which can be access controlled, reasoned about, and which encapsulates software lifecycle decisions such as rollout policy and team resource ownership. Service acts only as an orchestrator of the underlying Routes and Configurations (much as a kubernetes Deployment orchestrates ReplicaSets), and its usage is optional but recommended. The Service\u2019s controller will track the statuses of its owned Configuration and Route, reflecting their statuses and conditions as its own.

The digest is resolved during the creation of Revision. This field holds the digest value regardless of whether a tag or digest was originally specified in the Container object. It may be empty if the image comes from a registry listed to skip resolution. If multiple containers specified then DeprecatedImageDigest holds the digest for serving container. DEPRECATED: Use ContainerStatuses instead. TODO(savitaashture) Remove deprecatedImageDigest. ref https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy for deprecation. containerStatuses []ContainerStatus (Optional) ContainerStatuses is a slice of images present in .Spec.Container[*].Image to their respective digests and their container name.

Field Description Status knative.dev/pkg/apis/duck/v1.Status (Members of Status are embedded into this type.) RouteStatusFields RouteStatusFields (Members of RouteStatusFields are embedded into this type.) RouteStatusFields ( Appears on: RouteStatus , ServiceStatus ) RouteStatusFields holds the fields of Route\u2019s status that are not generally shared. This is defined separately and inlined so that other types can readily consume these fields via duck typing.

RoutingState ( string alias) RoutingState represents states of a revision with regards to serving a route. Value Description \"active\" RoutingStateActive is a state for a revision which is actively referenced by a Route. \"pending\" RoutingStatePending is a state after a revision is created, but before its routing state has been determined. It is treated like active for the purposes of revision garbage collection. \"reserve\" RoutingStateReserve is a state for a revision which is no longer referenced by a Route, and is scaled down, but may be rapidly pinned to a route to be made active again. \"\" RoutingStateUnset is the empty value for routing state, this state is unexpected. ServiceSpec ( Appears on: Service ) ServiceSpec represents the configuration for the Service object. A Service\u2019s specification is the union of the specifications for a Route and Configuration. The Service restricts what can be expressed in these fields, e.g. the Route must reference the provided Configuration; however, these limitations also enable friendlier defaulting, e.g. Route never needs a Configuration name, and may be defaulted to the appropriate \u201crun latest\u201d spec. Field Description ConfigurationSpec ConfigurationSpec (Members of ConfigurationSpec are embedded into this type.) ServiceSpec inlines an unrestricted ConfigurationSpec. RouteSpec RouteSpec (Members of RouteSpec are embedded into this type.) ServiceSpec inlines RouteSpec and restricts/defaults its fields via webhook. In particular, this spec can only reference this Service\u2019s configuration and revisions (which also influences defaults).

This is mutually exclusive with ConfigurationName. configurationName string (Optional) ConfigurationName of a configuration to whose latest revision we will send this portion of traffic. When the \u201cstatus.latestReadyRevisionName\u201d of the referenced configuration changes, we will automatically migrate traffic from the prior \u201clatest ready\u201d revision to the new one. This field is never set in Route\u2019s status, only its spec. This is mutually exclusive with RevisionName. latestRevision bool (Optional) LatestRevision may be optionally provided to indicate that the latest ready Revision of the Configuration should be used for this traffic target. When provided LatestRevision must be true if RevisionName is empty; it must be false when RevisionName is non-empty. percent int64 (Optional) Percent indicates that percentage based routing should be used and the value indicates the percent of traffic that is be routed to this Revision or Configuration. 0 (zero) mean no traffic, 100 means all traffic. When percentage based routing is being used the follow rules apply: - the sum of all percent values must equal 100 - when not specified, the implied value for percent is zero for that particular Revision or Configuration url knative.dev/pkg/apis.URL (Optional) URL displays the URL for accessing named traffic targets. URL is displayed in status, and is disallowed on spec. URL must contain a scheme (e.g. http://) and a hostname, but may not contain anything else (e.g. basic auth, url path, etc.) serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1 Package v1alpha1 contains the v1alpha1 versions of the serving apis.

Serving is easy to get started with and scales to support advanced scenarios. The Knative Serving project provides middleware primitives that enable: Rapid deployment of serverless containers Automatic scaling up and down to zero Routing and network programming for Istio components Point-in-time snapshots of deployed code and configurations Serving resources \u00b6 Knative Serving defines a set of objects as Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). These objects are used to define and control how your serverless workload behaves on the cluster: Service : The service.serving.knative.dev resource automatically manages the whole lifecycle of your workload. It controls the creation of other objects to ensure that your app has a route, a configuration, and a new revision for each update of the service. Service can be defined to always route traffic to the latest revision or to a pinned revision. Route : The route.serving.knative.dev resource maps a network endpoint to one or more revisions. You can manage the traffic in several ways, including fractional traffic and named routes. Configuration : The configuration.serving.knative.dev resource maintains the desired state for your deployment. It provides a clean separation between code and configuration and follows the Twelve-Factor App methodology. Modifying a configuration creates a new revision. Revision : The revision.serving.knative.dev resource is a point-in-time snapshot of the code and configuration for each modification made to the workload. Revisions are immutable objects and can be retained for as long as useful. Knative Serving Revisions can be automatically scaled up and down according to incoming traffic. See Configuring the Autoscaler for more information. Getting Started \u00b6 To get started with Serving, check out one of the hello world sample projects. These projects use the Service resource, which manages all of the details for you. With the Service resource, a deployed service will automatically have a matching route and configuration created. Each time the Service is updated, a new revision is created. For more information on the resources and their interactions, see the Resource Types Overview in the Knative Serving repository.

While this is useful for services that need to be accessible from outside of the cluster, frequently you may be building a backend service which should not be available off-cluster. Knative provides two ways to enable private services which are only available inside the cluster: To make all services only cluster-local, change the default domain to svc.cluster.local by editing the config-domain config map . This will change all services deployed through Knative to only be published to the cluster, none will be available off-cluster. To make an individual service cluster-local, the service or route can be labeled in such a way to prevent it from getting published to the external gateway. Label a service to be cluster-local \u00b6 To configure a Knative service to only be available on the cluster-local network (and not on the public Internet), you can apply the networking.knative.dev/visibility=cluster-local label to the Knative service, route or Kubernetes service object. To label the Knative service: kubectl label kservice ${ KSVC_NAME } networking.knative.dev/visibility = cluster-local To label a route when the route is used directly without a Knative service: kubectl label route ${ ROUTE_NAME } networking.knative.dev/visibility = cluster-local To label a Kubernetes service: kubectl label service ${ SERVICE_NAME } networking.knative.dev/visibility = cluster-local By labeling the Kubernetes service it allows you to restrict visibility in a more fine-grained way. See subroutes for information about tagged routes. For example, you can deploy the Hello World sample and then convert it to be an cluster-local service by labeling the service: kubectl label kservice helloworld-go networking.knative.dev/visibility = cluster-local You can then verify that the change has been made by verifying the URL for the helloworld-go service: kubectl get kservice helloworld-go NAME URL LATESTCREATED LATESTREADY READY REASON helloworld-go http://helloworld-go.default.svc.cluster.local helloworld-go-2bz5l helloworld-go-2bz5l True The service returns the a URL with the svc.cluster.local domain, indicating the service is only available in the cluster local network.","title":"Configuing Cluster-Local Services"},{"location":"serving/cluster-local-route/#label-a-service-to-be-cluster-local","text":"To configure a Knative service to only be available on the cluster-local network (and not on the public Internet), you can apply the networking.knative.dev/visibility=cluster-local label to the Knative service, route or Kubernetes service object.

In an HA deployment, if an active controller crashes or is deleted, another controller is available to take over processing of the APIs that were being serviced by the controller that is now unavailable. When using a leader election HA pattern, instances of controllers are already scheduled and running inside the cluster before they are required. These controller instances compete to use a shared resource, known as the leader election lock. The instance of the controller that has access to the leader election lock resource at any given time is referred to as the leader. Leader election is enabled by default for all Knative Serving components. HA functionality is disabled by default for all Knative Serving components, which are configured with only one replica. Disabling leader election \u00b6 For components leveraging leader election to achieve HA, this capability can be disabled by passing the flag: --disable-ha . This option will go away when HA graduates to \"stable\". Scaling the control plane \u00b6 With the exception of the activator component you can scale up any deployment running in knative-serving (or kourier-system ) with a command like: $ kubectl -n knative-serving scale deployment <deployment-name> --replicas=2 Setting --replicas to a value of 2 enables HA. You can use a higher value if you have a use case that requires more replicas of a deployment. For example, if you require a minimum of 3 controller deployments, set --replicas=3 . Setting --replicas=1 disables HA. NOTE: If you scale down the autoscaler component, you may observe inaccurate autoscaling results for some revisions for a period of time up to the stable-window value. This is because when an autoscaler pod is terminating, ownership of the revisions belonging to that pod is passed to other autoscaler pods that are on stand by. The autoscaler pods that take over ownership of those revisions use the stable-window time to build the scaling metrics state for those revisions. Scaling the data plane \u00b6 The scale of the activator component is governed by the Kubernetes HPA component.

The API aims to be portable and abstracts away the specificities of each users' implementation. That being said, the Knative API should empower users to surface extra features and extensions possible within their platform of choice. This document introduces two concepts: * Feature: a way to stage the introduction of features to the Knative API. * Extension: a way to extend Knative beyond the portable concepts of the Knative API. Control \u00b6 Features and extensions are controlled by flags defined in the config-features ConfigMap in the knative-serving namespace. Flags can have the following values: Enabled: the feature is enabled. Allowed: the feature may be enabled (e.g. using an annotation or looser validation). Disabled: the feature cannot be enabled. These three states don't make sense for all features. Let's consider two types of features: multi-container and kubernetes.podspec-dryrun . multi-container allows the user to specify more than one container in the Knative Service spec. In this case, Enabled and Allowed are equivalent because using this feature requires to actually use it in the Knative Service spec. If a single container is specified, whether the feature is enabled or not doesn't change anything. kubernetes.podspec-dryrun changes the behavior of the Kubernetes implementation of the Knative API, but it has nothing to do with the Knative API itself. In this case, Enabled means the feature will be enabled unconditionally, Allowed means that the feature will be enabled only when specified with an annotation, and Disabled means that the feature cannot be used at all. Lifecyle \u00b6 Features and extensions go through 3 similar phases (Alpha, Beta, GA) but with important differences. Alpha means: Might be buggy. Enabling the feature may expose bugs. Support for feature may be dropped at any time without notice. The API may change in incompatible ways in a later software release without notice. Recommended for use only in short-lived testing clusters, due to increased risk of bugs and lack of long-term support. Beta means: The feature is well tested. Enabling the feature is considered safe. Support for the overall feature will not be dropped, though details may change. The schema and/or semantics of objects may change in incompatible ways in a subsequent beta or stable release. When this happens, we will provide instructions for migrating to the next version. This may require deleting, editing, or re-creating API objects. The editing process may require some thought. This may require downtime for applications that rely on the feature. Recommended for only non-business-critical uses because of potential for incompatible changes in subsequent releases. If you have multiple clusters that can be upgraded independently, you may be able to relax this restriction. General Availability (GA) means: Stable versions of features/extensions will appear in released software for many subsequent versions. Feature \u00b6 Features use flags to safely introduce new changes to the Knative API. Eventually, each feature will graduate to become fully part of the Knative API, and the flag guard will be removed. Alpha \u00b6 Disabled by default. Beta \u00b6 Enabled by default. GA \u00b6 The feature is always enabled; you cannot disable it. The corresponding feature flag is no longer needed. Extension \u00b6 An extension may surface details of a specific Knative implementation or features of the underlying environment. It is never intended for inclusion in the core Knative API due to its lack of portability. Each extension will always be controlled by a flag and never enabled by default.

Before you begin \u00b6 You need: A Kubernetes cluster with Knative Serving installed . An image of the app that you'd like to deploy available on a container registry. The image of the sample app used in this guide is available on Google Container Registry. Sample application \u00b6 This guide demonstrates the basic workflow for deploying the Hello World sample app (Go) from the Google Container Registry . You can use these steps as a guide for deploying your container images from other registries like Docker Hub . To deploy a local container image, you need to disable image tag resolution by running the following command: # Set to dev.local/local-image when deploying local container images docker tag local-image dev.local/local-image Learn more about image tag resolution. The Hello World sample app reads in an env variable, TARGET , then prints \"Hello World: \\${TARGET}!\". If TARGET isn't defined, it will print \"NOT SPECIFIED\". Creating your Deployment with the Knative CLI \u00b6 The easiest way to deploy a Knative Service is by using the Knative CLI kn . Prerequisite: Install the kn binary as described in Installing the Knative CLI It will create a corresponding resource description internally as when using a YAML file directly. kn provides a command-line mechanism for managing Services. It allows you to configure every aspect of a Service. The only mandatory flag for creating a Service is --image with the container image reference as value. To create a Service directly at the cluster, use: # Create a Knative service with the Knative CLI kn kn service create helloworld-go --image gcr.io/knative-samples/helloworld-go --env TARGET = \"Go Sample v1\" If you want to deploy the sample app, leave the --image config as-is. If you're deploying an image of your app, update the name of the Service and the value of the --image flag accordingly. Now that you have deployed the service, Knative will perform the following steps: Create a new immutable revision for this version of the app. Perform network programming to create a route, ingress, service, and load balancer for your app. Automatically scale your pods up and down based on traffic, including to zero active pods. Optional: Creating your Deployment with YAML \u00b6 Alternatively, to deploy an app using Knative, you can also create the configuration in a YAML file that defines a service. For more information about the Service object, see the Resource Types documentation . This configuration file specifies metadata about the application, points to the hosted image of the app for deployment, and allows the deployment to be configured. For more information about what configuration options are available, see the Serving spec documentation . To create the same application as in the previous kn example, create a new file named service.yaml , then copy and paste the following content into it: apiVersion : serving.knative.dev/v1 # Current version of Knative kind : Service metadata : name : helloworld-go # The name of the app namespace : default # The namespace the app will use spec : template : spec : containers : - image : gcr.io/knative-samples/helloworld-go # Reference to the image of the app env : - name : TARGET # The environment variable printed out by the sample app value : \"Go Sample v1\" If you want to deploy the sample app, leave the config file as-is. If you're deploying an image of your app, update the name of the Service ( .metadata.name ) and the reference to the container image ( .spec.containers[].image ) accordingly. From the directory where the new service.yaml file was created, apply the configuration: kubectl apply --filename service.yaml Now that you have deployed the service, Knative will perform the following steps: Create a new immutable revision for this version of the app. Perform network programming to create a route, ingress, service, and load balancer for your app. Automatically scale your pods up and down based on traffic, including to zero active pods.

To mitigate this problem Knative as of 0.20 release Knative provides users with a possibility to gradually shift the traffic to the latest revision. This is governed by a single parameter which denotes rollout-duration . The affected Configuration targets will be rolled out to 1% of traffic first and then in equal incremental steps for the rest of the assigned traffic. Note, that the rollout is purely time based and does not interact with the Autoscaling subsystem. This feature is available to untagged and tagged traffic targets configured for both Kservices and Kservice-less Routes. Configuring gradual Rollout \u00b6 This value currently can be configured on the cluster level (starting v0.20) via a setting in the config-network ConfigMap or per Kservice or Route using an annotation (staring v.0.21).

Configure secure HTTPS connections to enable your Knative services and routes to terminate external TLS connections . You can configure Knative to handle certificates that you manually specify, or you can enable Knative to automatically obtain and renew certificates. You can use either Certbot or cert-manager to obtain certificates. Both tools support TLS certificates but if you want to enable Knative for automatic TLS certificate provisioning, you must install and configure the cert-manager tool: Manually obtain and renew certificates : Both the Certbot and cert-manager tools can be used to manually obtain TLS certificates. In general, after you obtain a certificate, you must create a Kubernetes secret to use that certificate in your cluster. See the complete set of steps below for details about manually obtaining and configuring certificates. Enable Knative to automatically obtain and renew TLS certificates : You can also use cert-manager to configure Knative to automatically obtain new TLS certificates and renew existing ones. If you want to enable Knative to automatically provision TLS certificates, instead see the Enabling automatic TLS certificate provisioning topic. By default, the Let's Encrypt Certificate Authority (CA) is used to demonstrate how to enable HTTPS connections, but you can configure Knative to use any certificate from a CA that supports the ACME protocol. However, you must use and configure your certificate issuer to use the DNS-01 challenge type . Important: Certificates issued by Let's Encrypt are valid for only 90 days . Therefore, if you choose to manually obtain and configure your certificates, you must ensure that you renew each certificate before it expires. Before you begin \u00b6 You must meet the following requirements to enable secure HTTPS connections: Knative Serving must be installed. For details about installing the Serving component, see the Knative installation guides . You must configure your Knative cluster to use a custom domain . Important: Istio only supports a single certificate per Kubernetes cluster. To serve multiple domains using your Knative cluster, you must ensure that your new or existing certificate is signed for each of the domains that you want to serve. Obtaining a TLS certificate \u00b6 If you already have a signed certificate for your domain, see Manually adding a TLS certificate for details about configuring your Knative cluster. If you need a new TLS certificate, you can choose to use one of the following tools to obtain a certificate from Let's Encrypt: Setup Certbot to manually obtain Let's Encrypt certificates Setup cert-manager to either manually obtain a certificate, or to automatically provision certificates This page covers details for both of the above options. For details about using other CA's, see the tool's reference documentation: Certbot supported providers cert-manager supported providers Using Certbot to manually obtain Let\u2019s Encrypt certificates \u00b6 Use the following steps to install Certbot and the use the tool to manually obtain a TLS certificate from Let's Encrypt. Install Certbot by following the certbot-auto wrapper script instructions. Run the following command to use Certbot to request a certificate using DNS challenge during authorization: ./certbot-auto certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns -d '*.default.yourdomain.com' where -d specifies your domain. If you want to validate multiple domain's, you can include multiple flags: -d MY.EXAMPLEDOMAIN.1 -d MY.EXAMPLEDOMAIN.2 . For more information, see the Cerbot command-line reference. The Certbot tool walks you through the steps of validating that you own each domain that you specify by creating TXT records in those domains. Result: CertBot creates two files: Certificate: fullchain.pem Private key: privkey.pem What's next: Add the certificate and private key to your Knative cluster by creating a Kubernetes secret . Using cert-manager to obtain Let's Encrypt certificates \u00b6 You can install and use cert-manager to either manually obtain a certificate or to configure your Knative cluster for automatic certificate provisioning: Manual certificates : Install cert-manager and then use the tool to manually obtain a certificate.

To learn more about using secure connections in Knative, see Configuring HTTPS with TLS certificates . Automatic TLS provision mode \u00b6 Knative supports the following Auto TLS modes: Using DNS-01 challenge In this mode, your cluster needs to be able to talk to your DNS server to verify the ownership of your domain. - Provision Certificate per namespace is supported when using DNS-01 challenge mode. - This is the recommended mode for faster certificate provision. - In this mode, a single Certificate will be provisioned per namespace and is reused across the Knative Services within the same namespace. Provision Certificate per Knative Service is supported when using DNS-01 challenge mode. This is the recommended mode for better certificate islation between Knative Services. In this mode, a Certificate will be provisioned for each Knative Service. The TLS effective time is longer as it needs Certificate provision for each Knative Service creation. Using HTTP-01 challenge In this type, your cluster does not need to be able to talk to your DNS server. You must map your domain to the IP of the cluser ingress. When using HTTP-01 challenge, a certificate will be provisioned per Knative Service. HTTP-01 does not support provisioning a certificate per namespace. Before you begin \u00b6 You must meet the following prerequisites to enable Auto TLS: The following must be installed on your Knative cluster: Knative Serving . A Networking layer such as Kourier, Istio with SDS v1.3 or higher, Contour v1.1 or higher, or Gloo v0.18.16 or higher. See Install a networking layer or Istio with SDS, version 1.3 or higher . Note: Currently, Ambassador is unsupported for use with Auto TLS. cert-manager version 1.0.0 and higher . Your Knative cluster must be configured to use a custom domain . Your DNS provider must be setup and configured to your domain. If you want to use HTTP-01 challenge, you need to configure your custom domain to map to the IP of ingress. You can achieve this by adding a DNS A record to map the domain to the IP according to the instructions of your DNS provider. Enabling Auto TLS \u00b6 To enable support for Auto TLS in Knative: Create cert-manager ClusterIssuer \u00b6 Create and add the ClusterIssuer configuration file to your Knative cluster to define who issues the TLS certificates, how requests are validated, and which DNS provider validates those requests. ClusterIssuer for DNS-01 challenge \u00b6 Use the cert-manager reference to determine how to configure your ClusterIssuer file: - See the generic ClusterIssuer example - Also see the DNS01 example Example : Cloud DNS ClusterIssuer configuration file: The following letsencrypt-issuer named ClusterIssuer file is configured for the Let's Encrypt CA and Google Cloud DNS. Under spec , the Let's Encrypt account info, required DNS-01 challenge type, and Cloud DNS provider info defined. For the complete Google Cloud DNS example, see Configuring HTTPS with cert-manager and Google Cloud DNS . apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1alpha2 kind: ClusterIssuer metadata: name: letsencrypt-dns-issuer spec: acme: server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory # This will register an issuer with LetsEncrypt.

DNS-01 challenge only: Configure your DNS provider \u00b6 If you choose to use DNS-01 challenge, configure which DNS provider is used to validate the DNS-01 challenge requests. Instructions about configuring cert-manager, for all the supported DNS providers, are provided in DNS01 challenge providers and configuration instructions . Example: See how the Google Cloud DNS is defined as the provider: Configuring HTTPS with cert-manager and Google Cloud DNS Install networking-certmanager deployment \u00b6 Determine if networking-certmanager is already installed by running the following command: kubectl get deployment networking-certmanager -n knative-serving If networking-certmanager is not found, run the following command: kubectl apply --filename http://github.com/knative/net-certmanager/releases/download/ { 'provider' : 'mike' } /release.yaml Install networking-ns-cert component \u00b6 If you choose to use the mode of provisioning certificate per namespace, you need to install networking-ns-cert components. IMPORTANT: Provisioning a certificate per namespace only works with DNS-01 challenge. This component cannot be used with HTTP-01 challenge. Determine if networking-ns-cert deployment is already installed by running the following command: kubectl get deployment networking-ns-cert -n knative-serving If networking-ns-cert deployment is not found, run the following command: kubectl apply --filename http://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/ { 'provider' : 'mike' } /serving-nscert.yaml Configure config-certmanager ConfigMap \u00b6 Update your config-certmanager ConfigMap in the knative-serving namespace to reference your new ClusterIssuer .

Ensure that the file was updated successfully: kubectl get configmap config-certmanager --namespace knative-serving --output yaml Turn on Auto TLS \u00b6 Update the config-network ConfigMap in the knative-serving namespace to enable autoTLS and specify how HTTP requests are handled: Run the following command to edit your config-network ConfigMap: kubectl edit configmap config-network --namespace knative-serving Add the autoTLS: Enabled attribute under the data section: ... data: ... autoTLS: Enabled ... Example: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: config-network namespace: knative-serving data: ... autoTLS: Enabled ... Configure how HTTP and HTTPS requests are handled in the httpProtocol attribute. By default, Knative ingress is configured to serve HTTP traffic ( httpProtocol: Enabled ). Now that your cluster is configured to use TLS certificates and handle HTTPS traffic, you can specify whether or not any HTTP traffic is allowed. Supported httpProtocol values: Enabled : Serve HTTP traffic. Disabled : Rejects all HTTP traffic. Redirected : Responds to HTTP request with a 302 redirect to ask the clients to use HTTPS. ... data: ... autoTLS: Enabled ... Example: apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: config-network namespace: knative-serving data: ... autoTLS: Enabled ... httpProtocol: Redirected ... Note: When using HTTP-01 challenge, httpProtocol field has to be set to Enabled to make sure HTTP-01 challenge requests can be accepted by the cluster.

Learn more about using TLS certificates in Knative: Configuring HTTPS with TLS certificates Enabling automatic TLS certificate provisioning Before you begin \u00b6 You must meet the following prerequisites to configure Knative with cert-manager and Cloud DNS: You must have a GCP project ID with owner privileges . Google Cloud DNS must set up and configure for your domain. You must have a Knative cluster with the following requirements: Knative Serving running. The Knative cluster must be running on Google Cloud Platform. For details about installing the Serving component, see the Knative installation guides . Your Knative cluster must be configured to use a custom domain . cert-manager v0.6.1 or higher installed Your DNS provider must be setup and configured to your domain. Creating a service account and using a Kubernetes secret \u00b6 To allow cert-manager to access and update the DNS record, you must create a service account in GCP, add the key in a Kubernetes secret, and then add that secret to your Knative cluster. Note that several example names are used in the following commands, for example secret or file names, which can all be changed to your liking. Create a service account in GCP with dns.admin project role by running the following commands, where <your-project-id> is the ID of your GCP project: # Set this to your GCP project ID export PROJECT_ID = <your-project-id> # Name of the service account you want to create. export CLOUD_DNS_SA = cert-manager-cloud-dns-admin gcloud --project $PROJECT_ID iam service-accounts \\ create $CLOUD_DNS_SA \\ --display-name \"Service Account to support ACME DNS-01 challenge.\" # Fully-qualified service account name also has project-id information. export CLOUD_DNS_SA = $CLOUD_DNS_SA @ $PROJECT_ID .iam.gserviceaccount.com # Bind the role dns.admin to this service account, so it can be used to support # the ACME DNS01 challenge. gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \\ --member serviceAccount: $CLOUD_DNS_SA \\ --role roles/dns.admin Download the service account key by running the following commands: # Make a temporary directory to store key KEY_DIRECTORY = ` mktemp -d ` # Download the secret key file for your service account. gcloud iam service-accounts keys create $KEY_DIRECTORY /cloud-dns-key.json \\ --iam-account = $CLOUD_DNS_SA Create a Kubernetes secret and then add that secret to your Knative cluster by running the following commands: # Upload that as a secret in your Kubernetes cluster. kubectl create secret --namespace cert-manager generic cloud-dns-key \\ --from-file = key.json = $KEY_DIRECTORY /cloud-dns-key.json # Delete the local secret rm -rf $KEY_DIRECTORY Adding your service account to cert-manager \u00b6 Create a ClusterIssuer configuration file to define how cert-manager obtains TLS certificates and how the requests are validated with Cloud DNS.

Cluster with Cloud DNS scope \u00b6 You can create a GKE cluster with Cloud DNS scope by entering the following command: gcloud container clusters create $CLUSTER_NAME \\ --zone = $CLUSTER_ZONE \\ --cluster-version = latest \\ --machine-type = n1-standard-4 \\ --enable-autoscaling --min-nodes = 1 --max-nodes = 10 \\ --enable-autorepair \\ --scopes = service-control,service-management,compute-rw,storage-ro,cloud-platform,logging-write,monitoring-write,pubsub,datastore, \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/ndev.clouddns.readwrite\" \\ --num-nodes = 3 Note that by using this way, any pod within the cluster will have permissions to read/write CloudDNS. Cluster with Cloud DNS Admin Service Account credential \u00b6 Create a GKE cluster without Cloud DNS scope by entering the following command: gcloud container clusters create $CLUSTER_NAME \\ --zone = $CLUSTER_ZONE \\ --cluster-version = latest \\ --machine-type = n1-standard-4 \\ --enable-autoscaling --min-nodes = 1 --max-nodes = 10 \\ --enable-autorepair \\ --scopes = service-control,service-management,compute-rw,storage-ro,cloud-platform,logging-write,monitoring-write,pubsub,datastore \\ --num-nodes = 3 Create a new service account for Cloud DNS admin role. # Name of the service account you want to create. export CLOUD_DNS_SA = cloud-dns-admin gcloud --project $PROJECT_NAME iam service-accounts \\ create $CLOUD_DNS_SA \\ --display-name \"Service Account to support ACME DNS-01 challenge.\" Bind the role dns.admin to the newly created service account. # Fully-qualified service account name also has project-id information. export CLOUD_DNS_SA = $CLOUD_DNS_SA @ $PROJECT_NAME .iam.gserviceaccount.com gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_NAME \\ --member serviceAccount: $CLOUD_DNS_SA \\ --role roles/dns.admin Download the secret key file for your service account. gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ~/key.json \\ --iam-account = $CLOUD_DNS_SA Upload the service account credential to your cluster. This command uses the secret name cloud-dns-key , but you can choose a different name. kubectl create secret generic cloud-dns-key \\ --from-file = key.json = $HOME /key.json Delete the local secret rm ~/key.json Now your cluster has the credential of your CloudDNS admin service account. And it can be used to access your Cloud DNS. You can enforce the access of the credentail secret within your cluster, so that only the pods that have the permission to get the credential secret can access your Cloud DNS. Set up Knative \u00b6 Follow the instruction to install Knative on your cluster. Configure Knative to use your custom domain. kubectl edit cm config-domain --namespace knative-serving This command opens your default text editor and allows you to edit the config map. apiVersion: v1 data: example.com: \"\" kind: ConfigMap [...] Edit the file to replace example.com with your custom domain (the value of $CUSTOM_DOMAIN ) and save your changes.

You can find detailed instructions for other cloud providers in the ExternalDNS documentation . Create a DNS zone for managing DNS records \u00b6 Skip this step if you already have a zone for managing the DNS records of your custom domain. A DNS zone which will contain the managed DNS records needs to be created. Use the following command to create a DNS zone with Google Cloud DNS : export DNS_ZONE_NAME = <dns-zone-name> gcloud dns managed-zones create $DNS_ZONE_NAME \\ --dns-name $CUSTOM_DOMAIN \\ --description \"Automatically managed zone by kubernetes.io/external-dns\" Make a note of the nameservers that were assigned to your new zone. gcloud dns record-sets list \\ --zone $DNS_ZONE_NAME \\ --name $CUSTOM_DOMAIN \\ --type NS You should see output similar to the following assuming your custom domain is external-dns-test.my-org.do : NAME TYPE TTL DATA external-dns-test.my-org.do. NS 21600 ns-cloud-e1.googledomains.com.,ns-cloud-e2.googledomains.com.,ns-cloud-e3.googledomains.com.,ns-cloud-e4.googledomains.com. In this case, the DNS nameservers are ns-cloud-{e1-e4}.googledomains.com .

These windows define the amount of historical data that the Autoscaler takes into account, and are used to smooth the data over the specified amount of time. The shorter these windows are, the more quickly the Autoscaler will react. The KPA's implementation has two modes: stable and panic . Stable mode is used for general operation, while panic mode by default has a much shorter window, and will be used to quickly scale a revision up if a burst of traffic arrives.

The system has a default target concurrency of 100 (Search for container-concurrency-target-default) but we used 10 for our service. We loaded the service with 50 concurrent requests so the autoscaler created 5 pods ( 50 concurrent requests / target of 10 = 5 pods ) Panic \u00b6 The autoscaler calculates average concurrency over a 60 second window so it takes a minute for the system to stablize at the desired level of concurrency. However the autoscaler also calculates a 6 second panic window and will enter panic mode if that window reached 2x the target concurrency. In panic mode the autoscaler operates on the shorter, more sensitive panic window. Once the panic conditions are no longer met for 60 seconds, the autoscaler will return to the initial 60 second stable window. | Panic Target---> +--| 20 | | | <------Panic Window | | Stable Target---> +-------------------------|--| 10 CONCURRENCY | | | | <-----------Stable Window | | | --------------------------+-------------------------+--+ 0 120 60 0 TIME Customization \u00b6 The autoscaler supports customization through annotations. There are two autoscaler classes built into Knative: kpa.autoscaling.knative.dev which is the concurrency-based autoscaler described above (the default), and hpa.autoscaling.knative.dev which delegates to the Kubernetes HPA which autoscales on CPU usage. Example of a Service scaled on CPU: apiVersion : serving.knative.dev/v1 kind : Service metadata : name : autoscale-go namespace : default spec : template : metadata : annotations : # Standard Kubernetes CPU-based autoscaling. autoscaling.knative.dev/class : hpa.autoscaling.knative.dev autoscaling.knative.dev/metric : cpu spec : containers : - image : gcr.io/knative-samples/autoscale-go:0.1 Additionally the autoscaler targets and scaling bounds can be specified in annotations. Example of a Service with custom targets and scale bounds: apiVersion : serving.knative.dev/v1 kind : Service metadata : name : autoscale-go namespace : default spec : template : metadata : annotations : # Knative concurrency-based autoscaling (default). autoscaling.knative.dev/class : kpa.autoscaling.knative.dev autoscaling.knative.dev/metric : concurrency # Target 10 requests in-flight per pod. autoscaling.knative.dev/target : \"10\" # Disable scale to zero with a minScale of 1. autoscaling.knative.dev/minScale : \"1\" # Limit scaling to 100 pods. autoscaling.knative.dev/maxScale : \"100\" spec : containers : - image : gcr.io/knative-samples/autoscale-go:0.1 Note: for an hpa.autoscaling.knative.dev class service, the autoscaling.knative.dev/target specifies the CPU percentage target (default \"80\" ).

With Knative, you can safely reroute traffic from a live version of an application to a new version by changing the routing configuration. Before you begin \u00b6 You need: A Kubernetes cluster with Knative installed . (Optional) A custom domain configured for use with Knative. Note: The source code for the gcr.io/knative-samples/knative-route-demo image that is used in this sample, is located at https://github.com/mchmarny/knative-route-demo. Deploying Revision 1 (Blue) \u00b6 We'll be deploying an image of a sample application that displays the text \"App v1\" on a blue background. First, create a new file called blue-green-demo-config.yaml and copy this into it: apiVersion : serving.knative.dev/v1 kind : Configuration metadata : name : blue-green-demo namespace : default spec : template : spec : containers : - image : gcr.io/knative-samples/knative-route-demo:blue # The URL to the sample app docker image env : - name : T_VERSION value : \"blue\" Save the file, then deploy the configuration to your cluster: kubectl apply --filename blue-green-demo-config.yaml configuration \"blue-green-demo\" configured This will deploy the initial revision of the sample application. Before we can route traffic to this application we need to know the name of the initial revision which was just created. Using kubectl you can get it with the following command: kubectl get configurations blue-green-demo -o = jsonpath = '{.status.latestCreatedRevisionName}' The command above will return the name of the revision, it will be similar to blue-green-demo-lcfrd . In the rest of this document we will use this revision name, but yours will be different. To route inbound traffic to it, we need to define a route. Create a new file called blue-green-demo-route.yaml and copy the following YAML manifest into it (do not forget to edit the revision name): apiVersion : serving.knative.dev/v1 kind : Route metadata : name : blue-green-demo # The name of our route; appears in the URL to access the app namespace : default # The namespace we're working in; also appears in the URL to access the app spec : traffic : - revisionName : blue-green-demo-lcfrd percent : 100 # All traffic goes to this revision Save the file, then apply the route to your cluster: kubectl apply --filename blue-green-demo-route.yaml route \"blue-green-demo\" configured You'll now be able to view the sample app at the URL shown by: kubectl get route blue-green-demo Deploying Revision 2 (Green) \u00b6 Revision 2 of the sample application will display the text \"App v2\" on a green background. To create the new revision, we'll edit our existing configuration in blue-green-demo-config.yaml with an updated image and environment variables: apiVersion : serving.knative.dev/v1 kind : Configuration metadata : name : blue-green-demo # Configuration name is unchanged, since we're updating an existing Configuration namespace : default spec : template : spec : containers : - image : gcr.io/knative-samples/knative-route-demo:green # URL to the new version of the sample app docker image env : - name : T_VERSION value : \"green\" # Updated value for the T_VERSION environment variable Save the file, then apply the updated configuration to your cluster: kubectl apply --filename blue-green-demo-config.yaml configuration \"blue-green-demo\" configured Find the name of the second revision with the following command: kubectl get configurations blue-green-demo -o = jsonpath = '{.status.latestCreatedRevisionName}' In the rest of this document we will assume that the second revision is called blue-green-demo-m9548 , however yours will differ. Make sure to use the correct name of the second revision in the manifests that follow.

Services"},{"location":"serving/services/creating-services/","text":"Knative Services are used to deploy an application. Each Knative Service is defined by a Route and a Configuration, which have the same name as the Service, contained in a YAML file. Every time the Configuration is updated, a new Revision is created. Knative Service Revisions are each backed by a deployment with 2 Kubernetes Services. For more information about Kubernetes Services, see the Kubernetes documentation . Before you begin \u00b6 To create a Knative Service, you will need: A Kubernetes cluster with Knative installed . Custom domains set up for Knative Services. Creating a Knative Service \u00b6 To create an application, you need to create a YAML file that defines a Knative Service. This YAML file specifies metadata about the application, points to the hosted image of the app and allows the Service to be configured. This guide uses the Hello World sample app in Go to demonstrate the structure of a Service YAML file and the basic workflow for deploying an app. These steps can be adapted for your own application if you have an image of it available on Docker Hub, Google Container Registry, or another container image registry. The Hello World sample app does the following: 1. Reads an environment variable TARGET . 2. Prints Hello ${TARGET}! . If TARGET is not defined, it will use World as the TARGET . Procedure \u00b6 Create a new file named service.yaml containing the following information. apiVersion : serving.knative.dev/v1 kind : Service metadata : name : helloworld-go namespace : default spec : template : spec : containers : - image : gcr.io/knative-samples/helloworld-go env : - name : TARGET value : \"Go Sample v1\" apiVersion : The current Knative version. name (metadata): The name of the application. namespace : The namespace that the application will use. image : The URL to the image of the application. name (env): The environment variable printed out by the sample application. Note: If you\u2019re deploying an image of your own app, update the name of the app and the URL of the image accordingly. From the directory where the new service.yaml file was created, deploy the application by applying the service.yaml file. kubectl apply --filename service.yaml Now that your app has been deployed, Knative will perform the following steps: Create a new immutable revision for this version of the app. Perform network programming to create a route, ingress, service, and load balancer for your app. Automatically scale your pods up and down based on traffic, including to zero active pods. Modifying Knative Services \u00b6 Any changes to specifications, metadata labels, or metadata annotations for a Service must be copied to the Route and Configuration owned by that Service. The serving.knative.dev/service label on the Route and Configuration must also be set to the name of the Service. Any additional labels or annotations on the Route and Configuration not specified above must be removed. The Service updates its status fields based on the corresponding status value for the owned Route and Configuration. The Service must include conditions of RoutesReady and ConfigurationsReady in addition to the generic Ready condition. Other conditions can also be present. What's next? \u00b6 For more information about the Knative Service object, see the Resource Types documentation.

If TARGET is not defined, it will use World as the TARGET .","title":"Creating a Knative Service"},{"location":"serving/services/creating-services/#procedure","text":"Create a new file named service.yaml containing the following information. apiVersion : serving.knative.dev/v1 kind : Service metadata : name : helloworld-go namespace : default spec : template : spec : containers : - image : gcr.io/knative-samples/helloworld-go env : - name : TARGET value : \"Go Sample v1\" apiVersion : The current Knative version. name (metadata): The name of the application. namespace : The namespace that the application will use. image : The URL to the image of the application. name (env): The environment variable printed out by the sample application.

From the directory where the new service.yaml file was created, deploy the application by applying the service.yaml file. kubectl apply --filename service.yaml Now that your app has been deployed, Knative will perform the following steps: Create a new immutable revision for this version of the app. Perform network programming to create a route, ingress, service, and load balancer for your app. Automatically scale your pods up and down based on traffic, including to zero active pods.","title":"Procedure"},{"location":"serving/services/creating-services/#modifying-knative-services","text":"Any changes to specifications, metadata labels, or metadata annotations for a Service must be copied to the Route and Configuration owned by that Service. The serving.knative.dev/service label on the Route and Configuration must also be set to the name of the Service. Any additional labels or annotations on the Route and Configuration not specified above must be removed. The Service updates its status fields based on the corresponding status value for the owned Route and Configuration. The Service must include conditions of RoutesReady and ConfigurationsReady in addition to the generic Ready condition.

This ConfigMap, known as the Deployment ConfigMap, contains settings that determine how Kubernetes Deployment resources, that back Knative services, are configured. Accessing the Deployment ConfigMap \u00b6 To view the current Deployment ConfigMap: kubectl get configmap -n knative-serving config-deployment -oyaml Configuring progress deadlines \u00b6 Configuring progress deadline settings allows you to specify the maximum time, either in seconds or minutes, that you will wait for your Deployment to progress before the system reports back that the Deployment has failed progressing for the Knative Revision. By default, this value is set to 120 seconds. The value is expressed as a Go time.Duration string representation, but must be rounded to a second precision. The Knative Autoscaler component scales the revision to 0, and the Knative service enters a terminal Failed state, if the initial scale cannot be achieved within the time limit defined by this setting. You may want to configure this setting as a higher value if any of the following issues occur in your Knative deployment: It takes a long time to pull the Service image, due to the size of the image. It takes a long time for the Service to become READY , due to priming of the initial cache state. The cluster is relies on cluster autoscaling to allocate resources for new pods.
