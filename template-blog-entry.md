[**Copy a version of this template without the instructions**](#copy-the-template)

## Frontmatter

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) uses a set of metadata at the beginning of each page
called [frontmatter](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/)
to define website build required info as well as other blog page details.

Frontmatter is strict YAML syntax and must be added to the top of every
page. Example formatting template:

```yaml
---
# This section is called the "frontmatter" for your page
title: "Title for your page" # Use sentence case for titles and headings
linkTitle: "A shorten title" # Optional: Use/render a shorter title in the navigation menu.
author: "" # Your name
authorHandle: "" # Your GitHub ID
date: "" # Publishing date
description: "" # A short one-liner describing this blog entry
folderWithMediaFiles: "./images/<new-feature-name>" # The relative file path (ie. new folder) to any images, etc.
keywords: Releases, Steering committee, Demo, Events # Meta keywords for the content
---
```

Include a commented-out table with tracking info about reviews and approvals:
```
