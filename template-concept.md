# Concept Template

Use this template when writing conceptual topics.
Conceptual topics explain how things work or what things mean.
They provide helpful context to readers. They do not include procedures.

## Template

The template below includes the standard sections that should appear in conceptual topics, including a topic introduction sentence, an overview, and placeholders for additional sections and subsections.
Copy and paste the markdown from the template to use it in your topic.

```
This topic describes...
Write a sentence or two that describes the topic itself, not the subject of the topic.
The goal of the topic sentence is to help readers understand if this topic is for them.
For example, "This topic describes what Knative Serving is and how it works."
