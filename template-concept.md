# Concept Template

Use this template when writing conceptual topics.
Conceptual topics explain how things work or what things mean.
They provide helpful context to readers. They do not include procedures.

## Template

The template below includes the standard sections that should appear in conceptual topics, including a topic introduction sentence, an overview, and placeholders for additional sections and subsections.
Copy and paste the markdown from the template to use it in your topic.
