## What is Knative?
Knative brings "serverless" experience to kubernetes. It also tries to codify common patterns and best practices for
running applications while hiding away the complexity of doing that on kubernetes. It does so by providing two
components:
- Eventing - Management and delivery of events
- Serving - Request-driven compute that can scale to zero

## What will we learn in this tutorial?
This tutorial will serve as an introduction to Knative Eventing. Here we will install Knative Eventing, and go through
various event delivery scenarios an application may have. This tutorial will serve as an introduction to Channels, Subscriptions and Sequence in Knative Eventing.
