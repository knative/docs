## What is Knative?
Knative brings "serverless" experience to kubernetes. It also tries to codify common patterns and best practices for
running applications while hiding away the complexity of doing that on kubernetes. It does so by providing two
components:
- Eventing - Management and delivery of events
- Serving - Request-driven compute that can scale to zero

## What will we learn in this tutorial?
Knative Eventing supports multiple modes of usage. This tutorial will serve as an introduction to Broker-Trigger model in Knative Eventing.
